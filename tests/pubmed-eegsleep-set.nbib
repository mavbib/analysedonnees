AB  - The conservation of sleep across all animal species suggests that sleep serves a 
      vital function. We here report that sleep has a critical function in ensuring 
      metabolic homeostasis. Using real-time assessments of tetramethylammonium diffusion 
      and two-photon imaging in live mice, we show that natural sleep or anesthesia are 
      associated with a 60% increase in the interstitial space, resulting in a striking 
      increase in convective exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with interstitial fluid. In 
      turn, convective fluxes of interstitial fluid increased the rate of β-amyloid 
      clearance during sleep. Thus, the restorative function of sleep may be a consequence 
      of the enhanced removal of potentially neurotoxic waste products that accumulate in 
      the awake central nervous system.

PG  - 243-56
LID - 10.1177/1073858413500854 [doi]
AB  - Sleep spindles are extensively studied electroencephalographic rhythms that recur 
      periodically during non-rapid eye movement sleep and that are associated with 
      rhythmic discharges of neurons throughout the thalamocortical system. Their 
      occurrence thus constrains many aspects of the communication between thalamus and 
      cortex, ranging from sensory transmission, to cortical plasticity and learning, to 
      development and disease. I review these functional aspects in conjunction with novel 
      findings on the cellular and molecular makeup of spindle-pacemaking circuits. A 
      highlight in the search of roles for sleep spindles is the repeated finding that 
      spindles correlate with memory consolidation in humans and animals. By illustrating 
      that spindles are at the forefront understanding on how the brain might benefit from 
      sleep rhythms, I hope to stimulate further experimentation.

AB  - Endogenous rhythms of circalunar periodicity (∼29.5 days) and their underlying 
      molecular and genetic basis have been demonstrated in a number of marine species [1, 
      2]. In contrast, there is a great deal of folklore but no consistent association of 
      moon cycles with human physiology and behavior [3]. Here we show that subjective and 
      objective measures of sleep vary according to lunar phase and thus may reflect 
      circalunar rhythmicity in humans. To exclude confounders such as increased light at 
      night or the potential bias in perception regarding a lunar influence on sleep, we 
      retrospectively analyzed sleep structure, electroencephalographic activity during 
      non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, and secretion of the hormones melatonin and 
      cortisol found under stringently controlled laboratory conditions in a 
      cross-sectional setting. At no point during and after the study were volunteers or 
      investigators aware of the a posteriori analysis relative to lunar phase. We found 
      that around full moon, electroencephalogram (EEG) delta activity during NREM sleep, 
      an indicator of deep sleep, decreased by 30%, time to fall asleep increased by 
      5 min, and EEG-assessed total sleep duration was reduced by 20 min. These changes 
      were associated with a decrease in subjective sleep quality and diminished 
      endogenous melatonin levels. This is the first reliable evidence that a lunar rhythm 
      can modulate sleep structure in humans when measured under the highly controlled 
      conditions of a circadian laboratory study protocol without time cues.

TI  - Sleep as a biomarker for depression.
PG  - 632-45

AB  - Sleep is a complex biological process that involves cyclic changes of brain 
      activity. The smooth transition between wakefulness and sleep and cyclic succession 
      of sleep stages depend on the function of numerous neurotransmitters that 
      reciprocally influence each other. For this reason sleep is a very sensitive 
      biomarker of brain functioning. This article provides an overview of sleep changes 
      in depression, mechanisms involved in sleep regulation and pathophysiology 
      underlying depression, studies on sleep as a biomarker for depression, effects of 
      antidepressants on sleep EEG, and studies in depression with the use of quantitative 
      sleep EEG analysis. Research on sleep in depression has provided several valuable 
      biomarkers that are related to increased risk for depression, show worsening during 
      depressive episode, and are related to treatment outcome and relapse risk during 
      remission phase. Among many sleep parameters, increased REM density and diminished 
      delta sleep ratio deserve special interest. Sleep studies are also an important 
      research tool for antidepressant drug development. However, due to sensitivity of 
      sleep parameters to pharmacological interventions, the patients have to be 
      investigated before the start of pharmacological treatment or after washout from the 
      antidepressant drug, to obtain reliable data on disease-related biological processes 
      from polysomnography.

AB  - Brain rhythms regulate information processing in different states to enable learning 
      and memory formation. The <1 Hz sleep slow oscillation hallmarks slow-wave sleep and 
      is critical to memory consolidation. Here we show in sleeping humans that auditory 
      stimulation in phase with the ongoing rhythmic occurrence of slow oscillation up 
      states profoundly enhances the slow oscillation rhythm, phase-coupled spindle 
      activity, and, consequently, the consolidation of declarative memory. Stimulation 
      out of phase with the ongoing slow oscillation rhythm remained ineffective. 
      Closed-loop in-phase stimulation provides a straight-forward tool to enhance sleep 
      rhythms and their functional efficacy.

TI  - Neural decoding of visual imagery during sleep.
PG  - 639-42
LID - 10.1126/science.1234330 [doi]
AB  - Visual imagery during sleep has long been a topic of persistent speculation, but its 
      private nature has hampered objective analysis. Here we present a neural decoding 
      approach in which machine-learning models predict the contents of visual imagery 
      during the sleep-onset period, given measured brain activity, by discovering links 
      between human functional magnetic resonance imaging patterns and verbal reports with 
      the assistance of lexical and image databases. Decoding models trained on 
      stimulus-induced brain activity in visual cortical areas showed accurate 
      classification, detection, and identification of contents. Our findings demonstrate 
      that specific visual experience during sleep is represented by brain activity 
      patterns shared by stimulus perception, providing a means to uncover subjective 
      contents of dreaming using objective neural measurement.

TI  - Local origin of slow EEG waves during sleep.
PG  - 105-12
AB  - Neuronal activity mediating EEG slow waves consists of synchronous alternation of 
      intracellular active and silent states. Recent data demonstrate that each active 
      state of a sleep slow wave originates in a particular cortical location and 
      propagate to involve other cortical areas. Preferential sites of origin of these 
      waves are: the frontal cortex in adult humans, the associative cortex in cats and 
      the somatosensory cortex in mice. In the site of origin of these slow waves any 
      neuron can initiate a particular cycle, however there are neuronal groups with high 
      likelihood of triggering a particular cycle. In epileptic patients, these neurons 
      are mostly located in superficial layers, but in healthy experimental animals, 
      populations ofintrinsically bursting neurons with a high probability of triggering 
      spontaneous active states have been found in deeper cortical layers.

TI  - Sleep misperception, EEG characteristics and autonomic nervous system activity in

AB  - Misperception of Sleep Onset Latency, often found in Primary Insomnia, has been 
      cited to be influenced by hyperarousal, reflected in EEG- and ECG-related indices. 
      The aim of this retrospective study was to examine the association between Central 
      Nervous System (i.e. EEG) and Autonomic Nervous System activity in the Sleep Onset 
      Period and the first NREM sleep cycle in Primary Insomnia (n=17) and healthy 
      controls (n=11). Furthermore, the study examined the influence of elevated EEG and 
      Autonomic Nervous System activity on Stage2 sleep-protective mechanisms (K-complexes 
      and sleep spindles). Confirming previous findings, the Primary Insomnia-group 
      overestimated Sleep Onset Latency and this overestimation was correlated with 
      elevated EEG activity. A higher amount of beta EEG activity during the Sleep Onset 
      Period was correlated with the appearance of K-complexes immediately followed by a 
      sleep spindle in the Primary Insomnia-group. This can be interpreted as an extra 
      attempt to protect sleep continuity or as a failure of the sleep-protective role of 
      the K-complex by fast EEG frequencies following within one second. The strong 
      association found between K-alpha (K-complex within one second followed by 8-12 Hz 
      EEG activity) in Stage2 sleep and a lower parasympathetic Autonomic Nervous System 
      dominance (less high frequency HR) in Slow-wave sleep, further assumes a state of 
      hyperarousal continuing through sleep in Primary Insomnia.

AB  - Virtually every eukaryotic cell has an endogenous circadian clock and a biological 
      sex. These cell-based clocks have been conceptualized as oscillators whose phase can 
      be reset by internal signals such as hormones, and external cues such as light. The 
      present review highlights the inter-relationship between circadian clocks and sex 
      differences. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as a master clock 
      synchronizing the phase of clocks throughout the body. Gonadal steroid receptors are 
      expressed in almost every site that receives direct SCN input. Here we review sex 
      differences in the circadian timing system in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 
      axis (HPG), the hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary (HPA) axis, and sleep-arousal 
      systems. We also point to ways in which disruption of circadian rhythms within these 
      systems differs in the sexes and is associated with dysfunction and disease. 
      Understanding sex differentiated circadian timing systems can lead to improved 
      treatment strategies for these conditions.

TI  - [Sleep in cetaceans].
PG  - 61-74
AB  - Over the course of evolution, cetaceans have adapted to sleep in conditions that can 
      be considered extreme for warm-blooded and air breathing animals. Studies of sleep 
      in cetaceans have led to the discovery of an unusual type of sleep called 
      unihemispheric slow wave sleep. The ability of cetaceans to sleep during swimming 
      and to close only one eye at a time are two other features of their sleep, directly 
      related to its unihemispheric nature. Paradoxical sleep in the form it is recorded 
      in all terrestrial mammals is absent in cetaceans. The pattern of sleep in cetaceans 
      allows them to 1) monitor the environment for predators and conspecifics to maintain 
      group coherence, 2) surface regularly for breathing and 3) maintain effective 
      thermoregulation.

AB  - This retrospective case study describes the sleep-wake cycles of an infant in the 
      neonatal intensive care unit. We analyzed video-electroencephalographic recording of 
      the term infant monitored during treatment with therapeutic hypothermia for 
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The continuous video-electroencephalographic 
      recording over a 4-day period also allowed us to describe the following dimensions 
      of daily care in relation to the infant's sleep-wake states: (1) handling by 
      professional and parent caregivers and (2) stress, pain, and analgesia. Physical 
      contact constituted 17% to 36% of each 24-hour period. The infant's care was 
      fragmented, with a mean of 3 to 4 physical contacts per hour. As a result, the 
      structure of infant sleep was altered by the increased amount of awake and quiet 
      sleep. The number of painful procedures ranged from 5 to 24 per day. Nurses were the 
      main care providers. Parents had more contact after the infant was rewarmed. This 
      case study suggests that neonatal intensive care unit infants are exposed to 
      frequent handling and stress as well as altered sleep. The cumulative negative 
      impact of frequent handling and sleep fragmentation may go unnoticed by caregivers 
      focused on episodes of care. Continuous video-electroencephalographic monitoring is 
      a useful tool for longitudinal evaluation of infant sleep and responses to 
      caregiving in the neonatal intensive care unit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This communication is the second of a two-part series that describes and 
      tests a new methodology for assessing the propagation of EEG sleep spindles. Whereas 
      the first part describes the methodology in detail, this part proposes a thorough 
      evaluation of the approach by applying it to a sample of laboratory sleep 
      recordings. NEW METHOD: The tested methodology is based on the alignment of 
      time-frequency representations of spindle activity across recording channels and is 
      used for assessing sleep spindle propagation over the human scalp using noninvasive 
      EEG. RESULTS: Spindle propagation displays features that suggest wave displacements 
      of global synaptic potential fields. Propagation patterns that are coherent (as 
      opposed to random), laterally symmetrical, and highly repeatable within and between 
      subjects were observed. Propagation was slower from posterior to anterior and from 
      central to lateral brain regions than in the opposite directions. Propagation speeds 
      varying between 2.3 and 7.0m/s were obtained. A distinct grouping of propagation 
      properties was noted for a small cluster of frontal electrodes. No propagation 
      between distantly separated scalp locations was observed. The values of spindle 
      characteristics such as average frequency, RMS amplitude, frequency slope, and 
      duration, depend largely on propagation direction but are only mildly correlated 
      with propagation delay. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Results obtained are in 
      line with many results published in the literature and offer new measures for 
      describing sleep spindle behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Propagation properties provide new 
      information about sleep spindle behavior and thus allow more precise automated 
      assessments of spindle-related functions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To show that EEG markers formed using the variable percent recurrence 
      reliably quantified two related aspects of sleep quality, sleep depth and sleep 
      fragmentation. As hypotheses, the depth marker would increase and the fragmentation 
      marker decrease in patients where improved sleep quality occurred when assessed by 
      polysomnography. METHODS: The patients (N=20) had been diagnosed with obstructive 
      sleep apnea during diagnostic polysomnography (dPSG), and had exhibited increased 
      REM sleep (clinical indication of improved sleep quality) during subsequent 
      polysomnography to titrate the pressure of a treatment device (cPSG). Percent 
      recurrence was computed second-by-second from the EEG; sleep-depth and 
      sleep-stability markers were obtained algorithmically. By assumption, the markers 
      contained temporal information regarding the extent of deterministic (non-random) 
      brain activity. Marker means were compared between the dPSG and the cPSG for NREM 
      and REM sleep. RESULTS: Sleep depth was greater and sleep fragmentation was less 
      during cPSG, as hypothesized (P<0.05). The effects occurred during NREM and REM 
      sleep, but were greater during NREM sleep (P<0.05). At least one of the predicted 
      changes occurred in 95% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The factors generally regarded 
      as responsible for subjective sleep quality were objectively quantified on the basis 
      of dynamical changes in the EEG.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A convergence of studies has revealed sleep spindles to be associated 
      with sleep-related cognitive processing and even with fundamental waking state 
      capacities such as intelligence. However, some spindle characteristics, such as 
      propagation direction and delay, may play a decisive role but are only infrequently 
      investigated because of technical complexities. NEW METHOD: A new methodology for 
      assessing sleep spindle propagation over the human scalp using noninvasive 
      electroencephalography (EEG) is described. This approach is based on the alignment 
      of time-frequency representations of spindle activity across recording channels. 
      RESULTS: This first of a two-part series concentrates on framing theoretical 
      considerations related to EEG spindle propagation and on detailing the methodology. 
      A short example application is provided that illustrates the repeatability of 
      results obtained with the new propagation measure in a sample of 32 night 
      recordings. A more comprehensive experimental investigation is presented in part two 
      of the series. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Compared to existing methods, 
      this approach is particularly well adapted for studying the propagation of sleep 
      spindles because it estimates time delays rather than phase synchrony and it 
      computes propagation properties for every individual spindle with windows adjusted 
      to the specific spindle duration. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methodology is effective 
      in tracking the propagation of spindles across the scalp and may thus help in 
      elucidating the temporal aspects of sleep spindle dynamics, as well as other 
      transient EEG and MEG events. A software implementation (the Spyndle Python package) 
      is provided as open source software.

AB  - The present review was undertaken to summarize studies elucidating sleep 
      microstructural differences in chronic insomnia. The etiology of insomnia is still 
      unknown, whereas the hyperarousal concept has gained much attention with respect to 
      pathophysiology. According to this model, insomnia is characterized by significant 
      hyperarousal on an autonomous and central nervous level. Objective findings derived 
      from polysomnography frequently show much less severe differences to good sleepers 
      than subjective sleep complaints assessed by self-rating questionnaires. However, 
      using more fine-grained methods to characterize the electrophysiology of sleep in 
      insomnia, rather distinct differences between the sleep of good sleepers and 
      patients with insomnia have been noted. These methods include the spectral analysis 
      of the sleep EEG, micro-arousal and CAP (cyclic alternating pattern) analysis as 
      well as the assessment of event-related potentials (ERPs) during night-sleep. The 
      application of these methods shows stronger correlations with the subjective 
      experience of disturbed sleep than standard sleep EEG scoring. An overview of the 
      relevant empirical evidence is presented, previous investigations are extended and a 
      theoretical synthesis within the framework of the hyperarousal concept of insomnia 
      is attempted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The multi-mode modulation is a key feature of sleep EEG. And the 
      short-term fractal property reflects the sympathovagal modulation of heart rate 
      variability (HRV). The properties of EEG and HRV strongly correlated with sleep 
      status and are interesting in clinic diagnosis. NEW METHOD: 19 healthy female 
      subjects were included for over-night standard polysomnographic study. Hilbert Huang 
      transform (HHT) was used to characterize the temporal features of slow- and 
      fast-wave oscillations decomposed from sleep EEG at different stages. Masking 
      signals were used for solving the mode-mixing problem in HHT. On the other hand, 
      detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) was used to assess short-term property of HRV 
      denoted as DFA α1, which reflects the temporal activity of autonomic nerve system 
      (ANS). Thus, the dynamic interaction between sleep EEG and HRV can be examined 
      through the relationship between the features of sleep EEG and DFA α1 of HRV. 
      RESULTS: The frequency feature of sleep EEG serves as a good indicator for the depth 
      of sleep during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and amplitude feature of 
      fast-wave oscillation is a good index for distinguishing rapid eye movement (REM) 
      from NREM sleep. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: The relationship between DFA α1 of 
      HRV and the mean amplitude of fast-wave oscillation of sleep EEG affirmed with 
      Pearson correlation coefficient is more significant than the correlation verified by 
      the traditional spectral analysis. CONCLUSION: The dynamic properties of sleep EEG 
      and HRV derived by EMD and DFA represent important features for cortex and ANS 
      activities during sleep.

AB  - Sleep disorders are serious issues in modern society. There has been marked 
      scientific interest in sleep for a century, with the discoveries of the electrical 
      activity of the brain (EEG), sleep-wake system, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and 
      circadian rhythm system. Additionally, the advent of video-polysomnography in 
      clinical research has revealed some of the consequences of disrupted sleep and sleep 
      deprivation in psychiatric disorders. Decades of clinical research have demonstrated 
      that sleep disorders are intimately tied to not only physical disease (e. g., 
      lifestyle-related disease) but psychiatric illness. According to The International 
      Classification of Sleep Disorders (2005), sleep disorders are classified into 8 
      major categories: 1) insomnia, 2) sleep-related breathing disorders, 3) hypersomnias 
      of central origin, 4) circadian rhythm sleep disorders, 5) parasomnias, 6) 
      sleep-related movement disorders, 7) isolated symptoms, and 8) other sleep 
      disorders. Several sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, 
      restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, sleepwalking, REM sleep 
      behavior disorder, and narcolepsy, may be comorbid or possibly mimic numerous 
      psychiatric disorders, and can even occur due to psychiatric pharmacotherapy. 
      Moreover, sleep disorders may exacerbate underlying psychiatric disorders when left 
      untreated. Therefore, psychiatrists should pay attention to the intimate 
      relationship between sleep disorders and psychiatric symptoms. Sleep psychiatry is 
      an academic field focusing on interrelations between sleep medicine and psychiatry. 
      This mini-review summarizes recent findings in sleep psychiatry. Future research on 
      the bidirectional relation between sleep disturbance and psychiatric symptoms will 
      shed light on the pathophysiological view of psychiatric disorders and sleep 
      disorders.

AB  - In patients with depression, characteristic changes of sleep electroencephalogram 
      and nocturnal hormone secretion occur including rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 
      disinhibition, reduced non-REM sleep and impaired sleep continuity. Neuropeptides 
      are common regulators of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and nocturnal hormone 
      secretion and changes in their activity appear to contribute to the aberrances of 
      sleep in affective disorders. A reciprocal interaction of the sleep-promoting growth 
      hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which 
      promotes wakefulness and REM sleep, plays a key role in sleep regulation, at least 
      in male subjects. Also galanin and ghrelin promote sleep in men. Neuropeptide Y is 
      involved in the timing of sleep onset. The effects of peptides of sleep are 
      influenced by the time of administration, age, gender and depression. In healthy 
      subjects and in remitted depressed patients motoric memory learning is consolidated 
      during sleep. This effect is absent in depressed patients who are at least 30 years 
      old, and is probably related to elevated glucocorticoid levels.

TI  - Longitudinal sleep EEG trajectories indicate complex patterns of adolescent brain 
      maturation.

AB  - New longitudinal sleep data spanning ages 6-10 yr are presented and combined with 
      previous data to analyze maturational trajectories of delta and theta EEG across 
      ages 6-18 yr in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. 
      NREM delta power (DP) increased from age 6 to age 8 yr and then declined. Its 
      highest rate of decline occurred between ages 12 and 16.5 yr. We attribute the delta 
      EEG trajectories to changes in synaptic density. Whatever their neuronal 
      underpinnings, these age curves can guide research into the molecular-genetic 
      mechanisms that underlie adolescent brain development. The DP trajectories in NREM 
      and REM sleep differed strikingly. DP in REM did not initially increase but declined 
      steadily from age 6 to age 16 yr. We hypothesize that the DP decline in REM reflects 
      maturation of the same brain arousal systems that eliminate delta waves in waking 
      EEG. Whereas the DP age curves differed in NREM and REM sleep, theta age curves were 
      similar in both, roughly paralleling the age trajectory of REM DP. The different 
      maturational curves for NREM delta and theta indicate that they serve different 
      brain functions despite having similar within-sleep dynamics and responses to sleep 
      loss. Period-amplitude analysis of NREM and REM delta waveforms revealed that the 
      age trends in DP were driven more by changes in wave amplitude rather than 
      incidence. These data further document the powerful and complex link between sleep 
      and brain maturation. Understanding this relationship would shed light on both brain 
      development and the function of sleep.

TI  - Respiratory-cycle related analysis of the EEG-spectrum during sleep: a healthy 
      population study.
PG  - 1940-3
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609907 [doi]
AB  - Recent research has shown the EEG's spectral changes that occur in synchrony with 
      the respiratory-cycle. During wakefulness, and for healthy subjects it is reported 
      that the EEG power in several frequency bands changes between the expiratory and 
      inspiratory phases. For sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) patients, it is reported 
      that the amplitude of changes in normalized EEG power (referred to as 
      respiratory-cycle related EEG changes RCREC) within a respiratory-cycle decreases 
      after a successful intervention to alleviate the SDB condition. In this paper, we 
      focus on analyzing the changes in the sleep’s EEG spectrum related to the 
      respiratory-cycle for a healthy population comprising 39 subjects. For 3 sleep 
      stages (N2, N3, REM), 6 EEG channels, and 7 frequency bands, two types of EEG 
      spectral analyzes were considered: 1) the ratio between the EEG power during 
      expiration and that during inspiration, and 2) the RCREC. For the first type of 
      analysis and at the population level, no statistically significant difference was 
      found between the EEG power during expiration and that during inspiration. For the 
      second type of analysis, the RCREC for all conditions is at a level that is 
      statistically significantly larger than 0.1. The latter being the value at which the 
      RCREC decreased after successful SDB intervention.

TI  - [Assessment of ADHD with EEG].
PG  - 312-6
LID - 10.4045/tidsskr.12.0224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many children with ADHD develop epilepsy, and approximately 20% of 
      children with epilepsy also have ADHD. In this article we discuss the use of EEG in 
      connection with ADHD in children, with emphasis on the diagnosis of comorbid 
      epilepsy. METHOD: The article is based on a literature search in PubMed, personal 
      literature archives and the authors' own experience with the use of EEG, treatment 
      of epilepsy and the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents. 
      RESULTS: A moderately elevated prevalence of epileptiform EEG activity is described 
      in children with ADHD without epilepsy compared with healthy children, during both 
      wakefulness and sleep. Selected material and a lack of controlled blinded studies 
      probably explain much of this difference. The significance of epileptiform EEG 
      activity in children with ADHD without seizures is uncertain. Evaluating the extent 
      to which EEG findings may explain the symptoms and whether anti-epileptic drugs 
      should be tried is a specialist task. In many studies, spectral analysis of the 
      frequency content of the EEG (QEEG) has shown higher slow theta activity and a 
      higher theta/beta ratio in children with ADHD. INTERPRETATION: Seizure symptoms, 
      disturbed sleep quality, significant changes in behaviour or regression of cognitive 
      ability in children with ADHD should lead to paediatric neurological assessment with 
      EEG and possibly a 24-hour EEG. In our view, the QEEG variables are artifact-prone 
      and biologically unspecific. We therefore do not recommend the use of QEEG as a 
      stand-alone diagnostic marker.

TI  - EEG power during waking and NREM sleep in primary insomnia.
PG  - 1031-7
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.3076 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathophysiological models of insomnia invoke the concept of 24-hour 
      hyperarousal, which could lead to symptoms and physiological findings during waking 
      and sleep. We hypothesized that this arousal could be seen in the waking 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) of individuals with primary insomnia (PI), and that 
      waking EEG power would correlate with non-REM (NREM) EEG. METHODS: Subjects included 
      50 PI and 32 good sleeper controls (GSC). Five minutes of eyes closed waking EEG 
      were collected at subjects' usual bedtimes, followed by polysomnography (PSG) at 
      habitual sleep times. An automated algorithm and visual editing were used to remove 
      artifacts from waking and sleep EEGs, followed by power spectral analysis to 
      estimate power from 0.5-32 Hz. RESULTS: We did not find significant differences in 
      waking or NREM EEG spectral power of PI and GSC. Significant correlations between 
      waking and NREM sleep power were observed across all frequency bands in the PI group 
      and in most frequency bands in the GSC group. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of 
      significant differences between groups in waking or NREM EEG power suggests that our 
      sample was not characterized by a high degree of cortical arousal. The consistent 
      correlations between waking and NREM EEG power suggest that, in samples with 
      elevated NREM EEG beta activity, waking EEG power may show a similar pattern.

TI  - Sleep for preserving and transforming episodic memory.
PG  - 79-102
LID - 10.1146/annurev-neuro-062012-170429 [doi]
AB  - Sleep is known to support memory consolidation. Here we review evidence for an 
      active system consolidation occurring during sleep. At the beginning of this process 
      is sleep's ability to preserve episodic experiences preferentially encoded in 
      hippocampal networks. Repeated neuronal reactivation of these representations during 
      slow-wave sleep transforms episodic representations into long-term memories, 
      redistributes them toward extrahippocampal networks, and qualitatively changes them 
      to decontextualized schema-like representations. Electroencephalographic (EEG) 
      oscillations regulate the underlying communication: Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples 
      coalescing with thalamic spindles mediate the bottom-up transfer of reactivated 
      memory information to extrahippocampal regions. Neocortical slow oscillations exert 
      a supraordinate top-down control to synchronize hippocampal reactivations of 
      specific memories to their excitable up-phase, thus allowing plastic changes in 
      extrahippocampal regions. We propose that reactivations during sleep are a general 
      mechanism underlying the abstraction of temporally stable invariants from a flow of 
      input that is solely structured in time, thus representing a basic mechanism of 
      memory formation.

AB  - It has been demonstrated in the rodent hippocampus that rhythmic slow activity 
      (theta) predominantly occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, while sharp 
      waves and associated ripples occur mainly during non-REM sleep. However, evidence is 
      lacking for correlates of sleep stages with electroencephalogram (EEG) in the 
      hippocampus of monkeys. In the present study, we recorded hippocampal EEG from the 
      dentate gyrus in monkeys overnight under conditions of polysomnographical 
      monitoring. As result, the hippocampal EEG changed in a manner similar to that of 
      the surface EEG: during wakefulness, the hippocampal EEG showed fast, desynchronized 
      waves, which were partly replaced with slower waves of intermediate amplitudes 
      during the shallow stages of non-REM sleep. During the deep stages of non-REM sleep, 
      continuous, slower oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) with high amplitudes were predominant. 
      During REM sleep, the hippocampal EEG again showed fast, desynchronized waves 
      similar to those found during wakefulness. These results indicate that in the 
      monkey, hippocampal rhythmic slow activity rarely occurs during REM sleep, which is 
      in clear contrast to that of rodents. In addition, the increase in the slower 
      oscillations of hippocampal EEG during non-REM sleep, which resembled that of the 
      surface EEG, may at least partly reflect cortical inputs to the dentate gyrus during 
      this behavioral state.

TI  - Quantitative changes in the sleep EEG at moderate altitude (1630 m and 2590 m).
PG  - e76945

LID - e76945
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have observed an altitude-dependent increase in central 
      apneas and a shift towards lighter sleep at altitudes >4000 m. Whether 
      altitude-dependent changes in the sleep EEG are also prevalent at moderate altitudes 
      of 1600 m and 2600 m remains largely unknown. Furthermore, the relationship between 
      sleep EEG variables and central apneas and oxygen saturation are of great interest 
      to understand the impact of hypoxia at moderate altitude on sleep. METHODS: 
      Fourty-four healthy men (mean age 25.0 ± 5.5 years) underwent polysomnographic 
      recordings during a baseline night at 490 m and four consecutive nights at 1630 m 
      and 2590 m (two nights each) in a randomized cross-over design. RESULTS: Comparison 
      of sleep EEG power density spectra of frontal (F3A2) and central (C3A2) derivations 
      at altitudes compared to baseline revealed that slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.8-4.6 Hz) 
      in non-REM sleep was reduced in an altitude-dependent manner (~4% at 1630 m and 15% 
      at 2590 m), while theta activity (4.6-8 Hz) was reduced only at the highest altitude 
      (10% at 2590 m). In addition, spindle peak height and frequency showed a modest 
      increase in the second night at 2590 m. SWA and theta activity were also reduced in 
      REM sleep. Correlations between spectral power and central apnea/hypopnea index 
      (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and oxygen saturation revealed that distinct 
      frequency bands were correlated with oxygen saturation (6.4-8 Hz and 13-14.4 Hz) and 
      breathing variables (AHI, ODI; 0.8-4.6 Hz). CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between SWA 
      and AHI/ODI suggests that respiratory disturbances contribute to the reduction in 
      SWA at altitude. Since SWA is a marker of sleep homeostasis, this might be 
      indicative of an inability to efficiently dissipate sleep pressure.

AB  - Chronic pain is a highly prevalent post-concussion symptom occurring in a majority 
      of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). About half of patients with 
      mTBI report sleep-wake disturbances. It is known that pain can alter sleep quality 
      in this population, but the interaction between pain and sleep is not fully 
      understood. This study aimed to identify how pain affects subjective sleep 
      (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), sleep architecture, and quantitative 
      electroencephalographic (qEEG) brain activity after mTBI. Twenty-four mTBI patients 
      complaining of sleep-wake disturbances, with and without pain (8 and 16, 
      respectively), were recruited 45 (±22.7) days post-trauma on average. Data were 
      compared with those of 18 healthy controls (no sleep or pain complaints). The PSQI, 
      sleep architecture, and qEEG activity were analyzed. Pain was assessed using 
      questionnaires and a 100-mm visual analogue scale. Patients with mTBI reported three 
      times poorer sleep quality than controls on the PSQI. Sleep architecture 
      significantly differed between patients with mTBI and controls but was within normal 
      range. Global qEEG showed lower delta (deep sleep) and higher beta and gamma power 
      (arousal) at certain EEG derivations in patients with mTBI compared with controls 
      (p<0.04). Patients with mTBI with pain, however, showed greater increase in rapid 
      EEG frequency bands, mostly during REM sleep, and beta bands in non-REM sleep 
      compared with patients with mTBI without pain and controls (p<0.001). Pain in 
      patients with mTBI was associated with more rapid qEEG activity, mostly during REM 
      sleep, suggesting that pain is associated with poor sleep and is a critical factor 
      in managing post-concussion symptoms.

AB  - Sleep spindles are distinctive electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations emerging 
      during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) that have been implicated in multiple 
      brain functions, including sleep quality, sensory gating, learning, and memory. 
      Despite considerable knowledge about the mechanisms underlying these neuronal 
      rhythms, their function remains poorly understood and current views are largely 
      based on correlational evidence. Here, we review recent studies in humans and 
      rodents that have begun to broaden our understanding of the role of spindles in the 
      normal and disordered brain. We show that newly identified molecular substrates of 
      spindle oscillations, in combination with evolving technological progress, offer 
      novel targets and tools to selectively manipulate spindles and dissect their role in 
      sleep-dependent processes.

TI  - Chloral hydrate versus hydroxyzine HCL for sedation prior to pediatric sleep EEG 
      recording.
PG  - 719-23
LID - 10.3109/00207454.2013.796310 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) can reveal certain epileptiform 
      activity patterns and facilitate localization of the focus. Sedation is often 
      required for sleep EEG recording in pediatric patients, but there is no consensus on 
      the optimal sedative. Hydroxyzine HCL (HH) and chloral hydrate (CH) are popular 
      sedatives, but HH is rarely used for pediatric sleep EEG recording. The goal of this 
      prospective study was to compare CH to HH for sleep induction efficacy, safety and 
      effects on pediatric sleep EEG pattern. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 282 
      children (age 4-9 years) referred to our sleep EEG laboratory and requiring sedation 
      were randomly assigned to two groups: the CH Group (n = 141) received 50 mg/kg CH 
      and the HH group (n = 141) received 1 mg/kg HH. If sedation was unsatisfactory, a 
      second equal dose of the same sedative was administered 30 min later. RESULTS: Sleep 
      induction was less successful in the HH group compared to the CH group (p < 0.001). 
      Sleep onset latency was significantly longer in the HH group (p < 0.01) and the 
      proportion of HH group patients requiring a second sedative dose significantly 
      higher (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients 
      exhibiting epileptiform activity on the EEG or in adverse event rate between groups. 
      CONCLUSION: CH was a superior sedative compared to HH owing to more rapid and 
      successful sleep induction with no increase in adverse events.

      regulation.
PG  - 311-23
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2440 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Besides their well-established role in circadian rhythms, our 
      findings that the forebrain expression of the clock-genes Per2 and Dbp increases and 
      decreases, respectively, in relation to time spent awake suggest they also play a 
      role in the homeostatic aspect of sleep regulation. Here, we determined whether time 
      of day modulates the effects of elevated sleep pressure on clock-gene expression. 
      Time of day effects were assessed also for recognized electrophysiological (EEG 
      delta power) and molecular (Homer1a) markers of sleep homeostasis. DESIGN: EEG and 
      qPCR data were obtained for baseline and recovery from 6-h sleep deprivation 
      starting at ZT0, -6, -12, or -18. SETTING: Mouse sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Male mice. INTERVENTIONS: Sleep deprivation. RESULTS: The sleep-deprivation induced 
      changes in Per2 and Dbp expression importantly varied with time of day, such that 
      Per2 could even decrease during sleep deprivations occurring at the decreasing phase 
      in baseline. Dbp showed similar, albeit opposite dynamics. These unexpected results 
      could be reliably predicted assuming that these transcripts behave according to a 
      driven damped harmonic oscillator. As expected, the sleep-wake distribution 
      accounted for a large degree of the changes in EEG delta power and Homer1a. 
      Nevertheless, the sleep deprivation-induced increase in delta power varied also with 
      time of day with higher than expected levels when recovery sleep started at dark 
      onset. CONCLUSIONS: Per2 and delta power are widely used as exclusive state 
      variables of the circadian and homeostatic process, respectively. Our findings 
      demonstrate a considerable cross-talk between these two processes. As Per2 in the 
      brain responds to both sleep loss and time of day, this molecule is well positioned 
      to keep track of and to anticipate homeostatic sleep need. CITATION: Curie T;

AB  - In pediatrics recording of EEG can range from premature infants aged just 25 weeks 
      of gestation to young adults. Recording EEG in pediatrics ranges from 25 weeks of 
      gestation premature in the incubator to young adults. Hence, recording conditions 
      need to be adapted to very different situations, not only of age but also of 
      environment, asepsis, and behavior.This requires that recording conditions be 
      adapted to very different situations, not only of age but also of environment, 
      asepsis and behavior. The two major determinants of EEG features are the level of 
      vigilance and age. Standard examination includes spontaneous sleep until the age of 
      5 years, and hyperventilation and intermittent light stimulation in older children. 
      Hyperventilation may modify the tracing in a physiological way until adolescence. 
      One of the major characteristics of a child's EEG recording is its course over time 
      that parallels rapid brain maturation. EEG changes are particularly rapid in early 
      age and they involve both temporal and spatial organization. In premature babies 
      modifications appear by two 2 weeks, in infancy by 1 month and in childhood by 1 
      year, before reaching the adult patterns at an age varying between 8 and 12 years of 
      age. Apart from being aware of the normal EEG patterns according to thein children 
      of different ages, it is important to recognize unusual patterns that are not linked 
      to a pathological situation. Most important are the interpretation and the 
      conclusion of the EEG tracing and any conclusions reached, for which and a precise 
      knowledge besides clinical information is mandatory for this purpose is essential.

AB  - In this paper, a new method for automatic sleep stage classification based on 
      time-frequency image (TFI) of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is proposed. 
      Automatic classification of sleep stages is an important part for diagnosis and 
      treatment of sleep disorders. The smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) 
      based time-frequency representation (TFR) of EEG signal has been used to obtain the 
      time-frequency image (TFI). The segmentation of TFI has been performed based on the 
      frequency-bands of the rhythms of EEG signals. The features derived from the 
      histogram of segmented TFI have been used as an input feature set to multiclass 
      least squares support vector machines (MC-LS-SVM) together with the radial basis 
      function (RBF), Mexican hat wavelet, and Morlet wavelet kernel functions for 
      automatic classification of sleep stages from EEG signals. The experimental results 
      are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for classification of 
      sleep stages from EEG signals.

AB  - The study of genetics is providing new and exciting insights into the pathogenesis, 
      diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Both normal sleep and several types of sleep 
      disturbances have been found to have significant genetic influences, as have traits 
      of normal sleep, such as those evident in EEG patterns and the circadian sleep-wake 
      cycle. The circadian sleep-wake cycle is based on a complex feedback loop of genetic 
      transcription over a 24-h cycle. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb 
      movements in sleep (PLMS) have familial aggregation, and several genes have a strong 
      association with them. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms linked to RLS/PLMS, although none has a definite functional 
      correlation. Narcolepsy/cataplexy are associated with HLA DQB1*0602 and a T-cell 
      receptor α locus, although functional correlations have not been evident. 
      Obstructive sleep apnea is a complex disorder involving multiple traits, such as 
      anatomy of the oropharynx, ventilatory control, and traits associated with obesity. 
      Although there is clear evidence of familial aggregation in the obstructive sleep 
      apnea syndrome, no specific gene or locus has been identified for it. 
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme has been proposed as a risk variant, but evidence is 
      weak. Fatal familial insomnia and advanced sleep phase syndrome are sleep disorders 
      with a definite genetic basis.

TI  - Cortical neuronal mechanisms of sleep homeostasis.
PG  - 13-23
AB  - The longer we are awake, the deeper is our subsequent sleep. On the other hand, the 
      shorter and more fragmented is our sleep, the more difficult it is for us to 
      maintain wakefulness and stable cognitive performance the next day. This 
      relationship between wakefulness and subsequent sleep becomes especially apparent 
      after sleep deprivation or during chronic sleep restriction, which is experienced by 
      millions of people in our society, as well as in multiple neurological, respiratory 
      and other chronic diseases. Invariably, poor sleep leads to fatigue, sleepiness, 
      marked cognitive deficits and impaired mood. The crucial question is what happens to 
      the brain after a period of being awake or asleep, and where in the brain and why do 
      these changes occur. This review summarizes information about neurophysiological 
      substrates of sleep homeostatic processes at the cellular and network levels. It is 
      suggested that sensory, behavioral and cognitive deficits after sleep deprivation 
      resulting from the imbalance between local and global neuronal interactions can be 
      reversed only by physiological sleep.

TI  - Sleep: a synchrony of cell activity-driven small network states.
PG  - 2199-209
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12238 [doi]
AB  - We posit a bottom-up sleep-regulatory paradigm in which state changes are initiated 
      within small networks as a consequence of local cell activity. Bottom-up regulatory 
      mechanisms are prevalent throughout nature, occurring in vastly different systems 
      and levels of organization. Synchronization of state without top-down regulation is 
      a fundamental property of large collections of small semi-autonomous entities. We 
      posit that such synchronization mechanisms are sufficient and necessary for 
      whole-organism sleep onset. Within the brain we posit that small networks of highly 
      interconnected neurons and glia, for example cortical columns, are semi-autonomous 
      units oscillating between sleep-like and wake-like states. We review evidence 
      showing that cells, small networks and regional areas of the brain share sleep-like 
      properties with whole-animal sleep. A testable hypothesis focused on how sleep is 
      initiated within local networks is presented. We posit that the release of cell 
      activity-dependent molecules, such as ATP and nitric oxide, into the extracellular 
      space initiates state changes within the local networks where they are produced. We 
      review mechanisms of ATP induction of sleep-regulatory substances and their actions 
      on receptor trafficking. Finally, we provide an example of how such local metabolic 
      and state changes provide mechanistic explanations for clinical conditions, such as 
      insomnia.

TI  - Principal component structuring of the non-REM Sleep EEG spectrum in older adults 
      yields age-related changes in the sleep and wake drives.
PG  - 280-93
AB  - Age-related disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle can reflect ontogenetic changes in 
      regulatory mechanisms underlying normal and pathological aging, but the exact nature 
      of these changes remains unclear. The present report is the first attempt to apply 
      principal component analysis to the electroencephalographic (EEG) spectrum to 
      examine of whether the observed age-related changes in the objective sleep measures 
      can be linked to the opponent sleep-promoting and wake-promoting processes. The EEG 
      indicators of these processes--scores on the 1st and 2nd principal components of the 
      EEG spectrum, respectively--were compared in 15 older (57-74 years) and 16 younger 
      (20-31 years) healthy volunteers. The scores were calculated for non-REM sleep 
      episodes which occurred during ten 75-min naps scheduled every 150 min throughout a 
      40-h constant routine protocol. Both, a decrease of the 1st principal component 
      score and an increase of the 2nd principal component score were found to contribute 
      to such most obvious age-related modification of the sleep EEG spectrum as 
      attenuation of EEG slow-wave activity in older people. Therefore, we concluded that 
      the normal aging process can reflect both a weakening of the sleep-promoting process 
      and a strengthening of the wake-promoting process, respectively. Such bidirectional 
      changes in chronoregulatory processes may explain why sleep of older people is 
      characterized by the few profitable and a number of detrimental features (i.e., a 
      better ability to cope with daytime sleepiness and sleep loss vs. difficulty of 
      falling asleep, decreased total nighttime sleep, "lightened" and fragmentized sleep, 
      unwanted early morning awakenings, etc.).

TI  - [The roles of glutamate in sleep and wakefulness].
PG  - 583-90
AB  - Glutamate as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, 
      participate in initiation and maintaining of sleep and wakefulness. The paper 
      presents an overview of the research progress of glutamate in the regulation of 
      sleep and wakefulness, especially focuses on its role in the brainstem, lateral 
      hypothalamus and basal forebrain. Glutamate in the brain stem regulates the brain 
      activity and maintains muscle tone during the wakefulness, as well as adjusts the 
      electroencephalograph (EEG) in rapid eye movement phase and leads to muscle 
      weakness. Glutamate in the lateral hypothalamus participates in the lateral 
      hypothalamic arousal system by activating orexins neurons. The basal forebrain 
      glutamatergic neurons take part in EEG synchronization and cause the decrease of 
      sleep. Finally,The glutamatergic neurons of the cerebral cortex is not just a target 
      of the arousal system, but itself contribute to regulation of arousal. Meantime, the 
      glutamatergic neurons can regulate sleep stages through interaction with other types 
      of neurons, which forms a complex sleep-wake regulation network in the brain. These 
      indicate that the switches between different phases of sleep and wakefulness have 
      different neuronal circuits.So we also reviewed the neuronal circuits and mechanisms 
      that glutamate may be involved in. This review will help us to get a better 
      understanding of the roles of glutamate in sleep and wakefulness.

PG  - 58-62
LID - 10.4045/tidsskr.12.0172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleeping problems are very common, and many patients need a 
      comprehensive assessment with polysomnography, possibly followed by a sleep latency 
      test. These methods and indications for the tests are described below. METHOD: The 
      article is based on the authors' own literature archives, clinical experience and 
      Retningslinjer for metoder i klinisk neurofysiologi [Guidelines for methodology in 
      clinical neurophysiology] RESULTS: Polysomnography involves monitoring sleep through 
      the course of one night and scoring the stages of sleep on the basis of EEG 
      activity, eye movements and muscular tension. Also recorded are inter alia 
      respiratory variables. Polysomnography followed by a multiple sleep latency test 
      (MSLT) is used when narcolepsy or excessive daytime sleepiness is suspected. If 
      parasomnia is suspected, the examination should include polysomnography, preferably 
      with video recording. If sleep apnoea is suspected in adults, respiratory polygraphy 
      is often sufficient. As a rule, polysomnography is preferable to respiratory 
      polygraphy for studying sleep disorders in children. INTERPRETATION: Sleep disorders 
      take many forms and are dealt with by many different specialities. Good cooperation 
      between the different specialities is necessary to ensure an optimal result for the 
      patients.

AB  - The topographic distribution of slow wave activity (SWA, EEG power between 0.75 and 
      4.5 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was proposed to mirror cortical 
      maturation with a typical age-related pattern. Here, we examined whether sex 
      differences occur in SWA topography of children and adolescents (22 age-matched 
      subjects, 11 boys, mean age 13.4 years, range: 8.7-19.4, and 11 girls, mean age 13.4 
      years, range: 9.1-19.0 years). In females, SWA during the first 60 min of NREM sleep 
      was higher over bilateral cortical areas that are related to language functions, 
      while in males SWA was increased over the right prefrontal cortex, a region also 
      involved in spatial abilities. We conclude that cortical areas governing functions 
      in which one sex outperforms the other exhibit increased sleep SWA and, thus, may 
      indicate maturation of sex-specific brain function and higher cortical plasticity 
      during development.

TI  - Time-linked concurrence of sleep bruxism, periodic limb movements, and EEG arousals

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep bruxism (SB) and periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) may 
      have a common underlying neurophysiologic mechanism, especially in relation to the 
      occurrence of sleep-related electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals. To test this 
      hypothesis, three research questions were assessed. First, it was assessed whether 
      PLMS events occur more frequently in SB patients than in individuals without SB. 
      Second, the question was put forward whether the combined presence of SB and PLMS 
      events is more common than that of isolated SB or PLMS events in a group of SB 
      patients. Third, as to further unravel the possible role of EEG arousals in the 
      underlying neurophysiologic mechanism of SB and PLMS, it was assessed in a group of 
      SB patients whether combined SB/PLMS events with associated EEG arousals are more 
      common than those without associated EEG arousals. Positive answers to these 
      questions could suggest a common neurophysiological basis for both movement 
      disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen SB patients and 11 healthy controls were 
      polysomnographically studied. SB, PLMS, and EEG arousals were scored. An association 
      was noted when the occurrence was within a 3-s association zone. RESULTS: The PLMS 
      index was higher in SB patients than in healthy controls (P < 0.001). Within the 
      group of SB patients, the combined SB/PLMS index was higher than the isolated SB 
      index (P < 0.001) and the isolated PLMS index (P = 0.018). Similarly, the combined 
      SB/PLMS index with EEG arousal was higher than the combined SB/PLMS index without 
      EEG arousal in SB patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study 
      indicate that SB, PLMS, and EEG arousals commonly concur during sleep in a 
      time-linked manner. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SB and PLMS probably have a common 
      underlying neurophysiological mechanism.

TI  - Developmental changes in sleep and their relationships to psychiatric illnesses.
PG  - 572-9
LID - 10.1097/YCO.0b013e328365a335 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sleep undergoes major changes during development. Its 
      relationship to the complex process of maturation in health and disease has recently 
      received increased attention. This review aims to highlight the recent literature 
      examining the interplay of altered sleep, brain development and emerging psychiatric 
      illnesses in children and adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to a temporal 
      relationship of sleep disturbances preceding the onset of psychiatric illnesses, a 
      bi-directional interaction of altered sleep and symptom severity has increasingly 
      been shown. Sleep architecture shows drastic age-dependent alterations on a 
      structural level during the first 2 decades of life. However, findings regarding 
      disease-specific patterns have remained inconsistent. On a functional level, recent 
      evidence about sleep electroencephalographic characteristics points to a close 
      relationship between slow waves, reflecting the depth of sleep, and cortical 
      plasticity. SUMMARY: Sleep provides a rich source of information to gain insight 
      into both the healthy and disturbed processes of brain function and maturation. 
      Emerging data suggest that the investigation of slow wave activity is a novel and 
      promising tool for monitoring both of these processes. It is important to understand 
      when and how deviations from typical developmental sleep alterations occur in order 
      to improve prevention and early treatment of disorders affecting a substantial 
      number of children and adolescents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disruption is a frequent occurrence in modern society. Whereas 
      many studies have focused on the consequences of total sleep deprivation, few have 
      investigated the condition of sleep disruption. NEW METHOD: We disrupted sleep of 
      mice during the light period for 9 consecutive days using an intermittently rotating 
      disc. RESULTS: Electroencephalogram (EEG) data demonstrated that non-rapid eye 
      movement (NREM) sleep was severely fragmented and REM sleep was essentially 
      abolished during the 12h light period. During the dark period, when sleep was not 
      disrupted, neither NREM sleep nor REM sleep times differed from control values. 
      Analysis of the EEG revealed a trend for increased power in the peak frequency of 
      the NREM EEG spectra during the dark period. The fragmentation protocol was not 
      overly stressful as body weights and water consumption remained unchanged, and 
      plasma corticosterone did not differ between mice subjected to 3 or 9 days of sleep 
      disruption and home cage controls. However, mice subjected to 9 days of sleep 
      disruption by this method responded to lipopolysaccharide with an exacerbated 
      febrile response. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Existing methods to disrupt 
      sleep of laboratory rodents often subject the animal to excessive locomotion, 
      vibration, or sudden movements. This method does not suffer from any of these 
      confounds. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that prolonged sleep disruption of 
      mice exacerbates febrile responses to lipopolysaccharide. This device provides a 
      method to determine mechanisms by which chronic insufficient sleep contributes to 
      the etiology of many pathologies, particularly those with an inflammatory component.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the current population, strokes are one of the most important 
      causes of morbidity and mortality, to which new risk factors are increasingly being 
      attributed. Of late, there is increased interest in the relationship between sleep 
      disorders and strokes as regards risk and prognosis. DEVELOPMENT: This article 
      presents the changes in sleep architecture and brain activity in stroke patients, as 
      well as the interaction between stroke and sleep disorders, including those which 
      may also influence the outcome and recovery from strokes. The different treatments 
      discussed in the literature are also reviewed, as correct treatment of such sleep 
      disorders may not only improve quality of life and reduce after-effects, but can 
      also increase life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disorders are becoming 
      increasingly associated with stroke. In addition to being a risk factor, they can 
      also interfere in the outcome and recovery of stroke patients. This article aims to 
      present an exhaustive and current review on strokes and their relationship with 
      sleep alterations and sleep disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In case series concerning the role of EEG after sleep deprivation 
      (SD-EEG) in epilepsy, patients' features and protocols vary dramatically from one 
      report to another. In this study, we assessed the usefulness of a simple SD-EEG 
      method in well characterized patients. METHODS: Among the 963 adult subjects 
      submitted to SD-EEG at our Center, in the period 2003-2010, we retrospectively 
      selected for analysis only those: (1) evaluated for suspected epileptic seizures; 
      (2) with a normal/non-specific baseline EEG; (3) still drug-free at the time of 
      SD-EEG; (4) with an MRI analysis; (5) with at least 1 year follow-up. SD-EEG 
      consisted in SD from 2:00 AM and laboratory EEG from 8:00 AM to 10:30 AM. We 
      analyzed epileptic interictal abnormalities (IIAs) and their correlations with 
      patients' features. RESULTS: Epilepsy was confirmed in 131 patients. SD-EEG showed 
      IIAs in 41.2% of all patients with epilepsy, and a 91.1% specificity for epilepsy 
      diagnosis; IIAs types observed during SD-EEG are different in generalized versus 
      focal epilepsies; for focal epilepsies, the IIAs yield in SD-EEG is higher than in 
      second routine EEG. CONCLUSIONS: This simple SD-EEG protocol is very useful in de 
      novo patients with suspected seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: This study sheds new light on 
      the role of SD-EEG in specific epilepsy populations.

TI  - Asymmetric sleep in apneic human patients.
PG  - R232-7
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00302.2011 [doi]
AB  - Unilateral sleep in marine mammals has been considered to be a defense against 
      airway obstruction, as a sentinel for pod maintenance, and as a thermoregulatory 
      mechanism. Birds also show asymmetric sleep, probably to avoid predation. The 
      variable function of asymmetric sleep suggests a general capability for independence 
      between brain hemispheres. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea share similar 
      problems with diving mammals, but their eventual sleep asymmetry has received little 
      attention. The present report shows that human sleep apnea patients also present 
      temporary interhemispheric variations in dominance during sleep, with significant 
      differences when comparing periods of open and closed airways. The magnitude of 
      squared coherence, an index of interhemispheric EEG interdependence in phase and 
      amplitude, rises in the delta EEG range during apneic episodes, while the phase lag 
      index, a measure of linear and nonlinear interhemispheric phase synchrony, drops to 
      zero. The L index, which measures generalized nonlinear EEG interhemispheric 
      synchronization, increases during apneic events. Thus, the three indexes show 
      significant and congruent changes in interhemispheric symmetry depending on the 
      state of the airways. In conclusion, when confronted with a respiratory challenge, 
      sleeping humans undergo small, but significant, breathing-related oscillations in 
      interhemispheric dominance, similar to those observed in marine mammals. The 
      evidence points to a relationship between cetacean unihemispheric sleep and their

TI  - Ethosuximide reduces ethanol withdrawal-mediated disruptions in sleep-related EEG 
      patterns.
PG  - 372-82
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2012.01938.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic ethanol (EtOH) leads to disruptions in resting 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and in sleep patterns that can persist into the 
      withdrawal period. These disruptions have been suggested to be predictors of 
      relapse. The thalamus is a key structure involved in both normal brain oscillations, 
      such as sleep-related oscillations, and abnormal rhythms found in disorders such as 
      epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Previously, we have shown progressive changes in 
      mouse thalamic T-type Ca channels during chronic intermittent EtOH exposures that 
      occurred in parallel with alterations in theta (4 to 8 Hz) EEG patterns. METHODS: 
      Two groups of 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were implanted with wireless 
      EEG/electromyogram (EMG) telemetry and subjected to 4 weeks of chronic, intermittent 
      EtOH vapor exposure and withdrawal. During the week after the final withdrawal, mice 
      were administered ethosuximide (ETX; 200 mg/kg) or saline. EEG data were analyzed 
      via discrete Fourier transform, and sleep-scored for further analysis. RESULTS: 
      Chronic intermittent EtOH exposure produced changes in the diurnal rhythms of the 
      delta (0.5 to 4 Hz) and theta bands that persisted into a subsequent week of 
      sustained withdrawal. These disruptions were restored with the T-channel blocker 
      ETX. Repeated EtOH exposures preferentially increased the relative proportion of 
      lower frequency power (delta and theta), whereas higher frequencies (8 to 24 Hz) 
      were decreased. The EtOH-induced decreases in relative power for the higher 
      frequencies continued into the sustained withdrawal week for both groups. Increases 
      in absolute delta and theta power were observed in averaged nonrapid eye movement 
      and rapid eye movement sleep spectral data during withdrawal in ETX-treated animals, 
      suggesting increased sleep intensity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 
      persistent alterations in delta and theta EEG rhythms during withdrawal from chronic 
      intermittent EtOH exposure can be ameliorated with ETX and that this treatment might 
      also increase sleep intensity during withdrawal.

TI  - Sleep in ring chromosome 20 syndrome: a peculiar electroencephalographic pattern.
PG  - 47-53
AB  - Ring chromosome 20 [r(20)] syndrome is a chromosomal disorder characterized by 
      epilepsy and intellectual disability. Distinctive electroclinical features and 
      wakefulness EEG patterns have been described. The EEG features of sleep have not yet 
      been evaluated. We studied the pattern of sleep in six patients aged 2-59 years who 
      underwent at least one polysomnographic recording. Their sleep pattern evolution is 
      described as deterioration ranging from normal to destructured NREM/REM sleep. NREM 
      sleep alterations were observed from childhood and were more evident in adulthood. 
      EEG abnormalities detected during wakefulness persisted, with morphological changes, 
      during sleep. During NREM sleep all the subjects presented high amplitude delta 
      sequences with a sharply contoured or notched appearance, prevalent over frontal 
      regions. The theta rhythm of wakefulness was seen to persist during REM sleep. Ring 
      chromosome 20 syndrome shows sleep alterations that seem to be age-related. A 
      potential role of cortical and thalamocortical dysfunction is discussed.

AB  - Until recently, neuroscience has given sleep research and discovery of better 
      treatments of sleep disturbances little attention, despite the fact that disturbed 
      sleep has overwhelming impact on human health. Sleep is a complex phenomenon in 
      which specific psychological, electrophysiological, neurochemical, endocrinological, 
      immunological and genetic factors are involved. The brain as both the generator and 
      main object of sleep is obviously of particular interest, which makes a 
      neuroscience-driven view the most promising approach to evaluate clinical 
      implications and applications of sleep research. Polysomnography as the gold 
      standard of sleep research, complemented by brain imaging, neuroendocrine testing, 
      genomics and other laboratory measures can help to create composite biomarkers that 
      allow maximizing the effects of individualized therapies while minimizing adverse 
      effects. Here we review the current state of the neuroscience of sleep, sleep 
      disorders and sleep therapeutics and will give some leads to promote the discovery 
      and development of sleep medicines that are better than those we have today.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has been associated with disturbed 
      sleep-wake cycles and cortical hypermetabolism. However, it still remains unclear 
      whether OCD is associated with a dysregulation of vigilance (i.e. "brain arousal"). 
      VIGALL (Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig) is an EEG-based tool to assess vigilance 
      dynamics. Aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that during resting state less 
      declines to lower vigilance stages are found in unmedicated patients with OCD (n=30) 
      compared to healthy controls (HCs, n=30). METHODS: Fifteen minutes of resting EEG 
      were recorded; preceding sleep duration, nicotine/caffeine consumption and severity 
      of OCD and depressive symptoms were assessed. RESULTS: Significant differences of 
      EEG-vigilance were found for the factor "group" (OCD vs. HC), factor "time" and 
      interaction "group×time" in a repeated measures ANOVA with increased EEG-vigilance 
      in OCD patients. OCD patients showed significantly fewer transitions between 
      EEG-vigilance stages. CONCLUSIONS: In line with findings of disturbed sleep 
      regulation, OCD is associated with altered EEG-vigilance regulation with a failure 
      of declining toward low vigilance stages during rest. SIGNIFICANCE: These results 
      encourage the use of EEG-vigilance regulation for determining subgroups for e.g. 
      studying treatment response and suggest awareness for possible vigilance effects in 
      neuroimaging studies of OCD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document the occurrence of genuine sleep stages in the early preterm 
      babies, and to develop an EEG-based index for following sleep wake cyclicity. 
      METHODS: Twelve preterm babies were recruited from a study that assessed ventilator 
      strategies. We used altogether 18 polysomnography recordings that were collected at 
      mean conceptional age of 29.3 (25.9-32.7) weeks. Spontaneous activity transients 
      (SAT) were detected automatically and their cumulative coverage in each 20s interval 
      was computed from the EEG derivations C3-A2 and O2-A1. Mean SAT% values between 
      sleep stages were compared. RESULTS: All babies exhibited all sleep stages, however 
      the sleep was remarkably fragmentary in infants due to their respiratory issues. The 
      EEG index, SAT% showed temporal behavior that strikingly well compared with the 
      sleep stage fluctuations in the hypnogram. In the statistical analysis we found 
      significant differences in all recordings between the deep (quiet) sleep and the REM 
      sleep. CONCLUSION: Genuine sleep states exist in the early preterm babies, and 
      changes in sleep stages are reflected in the EEG activity in a way that can be 
      readily measured by assessing fluctuation of the automatically detected, EEG based 
      index, the SAT%. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings open a possibility to construct 
      automated analysis or monitoring of sleep wake cyclicity into brain monitors in 
      neonatal intensive care unit.

TI  - Standardized computer-based organized reporting of EEG: SCORE.
PG  - 1112-24

AB  - The electroencephalography (EEG) signal has a high complexity, and the process of 
      extracting clinically relevant features is achieved by visual analysis of the 
      recordings. The interobserver agreement in EEG interpretation is only moderate. This 
      is partly due to the method of reporting the findings in free-text format. The 
      purpose of our endeavor was to create a computer-based system for EEG assessment and 
      reporting, where the physicians would construct the reports by choosing from 
      predefined elements for each relevant EEG feature, as well as the clinical phenomena 
      (for video-EEG recordings). A working group of EEG experts took part in consensus 
      workshops in Dianalund, Denmark, in 2010 and 2011. The faculty was approved by the 
      Commission on European Affairs of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). 
      The working group produced a consensus proposal that went through a pan-European 
      review process, organized by the European Chapter of the International Federation of 
      Clinical Neurophysiology. The Standardised Computer-based Organised Reporting of EEG 
      (SCORE) software was constructed based on the terms and features of the consensus 
      statement and it was tested in the clinical practice. The main elements of SCORE are 
      the following: personal data of the patient, referral data, recording conditions, 
      modulators, background activity, drowsiness and sleep, interictal findings, 
      "episodes" (clinical or subclinical events), physiologic patterns, patterns of 
      uncertain significance, artifacts, polygraphic channels, and diagnostic 
      significance. The following specific aspects of the neonatal EEGs are scored: 
      alertness, temporal organization, and spatial organization. For each EEG finding, 
      relevant features are scored using predefined terms. Definitions are provided for 
      all EEG terms and features. SCORE can potentially improve the quality of EEG 
      assessment and reporting; it will help incorporate the results of computer-assisted 
      analysis into the report, it will make possible the build-up of a multinational 
      database, and it will help in training young neurophysiologists.

AB  - Non-epileptic paroxysmal disorders during sleep are a great challenge for the 
      clinician. It is important to know the various clinical manifestations for 
      appropriate differential diagnosis, since alterations in sleep, mostly motor, are 
      part of these disorders. Our paper describes the normal sleep stages and 
      electroencephalographic characteristics and polysomnography basic data. The 
      confusions especially with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy are frequent and cause 
      unnecessary drugs administered, the emotional burden of the parents or caretakers, 
      which is the diagnosis of epilepsy. We discuss the possible causes of diagnostic 
      errors.

TI  - Multiscale entropy analysis of electroencephalography during sleep in patients with 
      Parkinson disease.
PG  - 221-6
LID - 10.1177/1550059412475066 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disorders are frequently seen in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), 
      including rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder and periodic limb movement 
      disorder. However, knowledge about changes in non-REM sleep in patients with PD is 
      limited. This study explored the characteristics of electroencephalography (EEG) 
      during sleep in patients with PD and non-PD controls. We further conducted 
      multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis to evaluate and compare the complexity of sleep 
      EEG for the 2 groups. There were 9 patients with PD (Hoehn-Yahr stage 1 or 2) and 11 
      non-PD controls. All participants underwent standard whole-night polysomnography 
      (PSG), which included 23 channels, 6 of which were for EEG. The raw data of the EEG 
      were extracted and subjected to MSE analysis. Patients with PD had a longer sleep 
      onset time and a higher spontaneous EEG arousal index. Sleep stage-specific 
      increased MSE was observed in patients with PD during non-REM sleep. The difference 
      was more marked and significant at higher time scale factors (TSFs). In conclusion, 
      increased biosignal complexity, as revealed by MSE analysis, was found in patients 
      with PD during non-REM sleep at high TSFs. This finding might reflect a compensatory 
      mechanism for early defects in neuronal network control machinery in PD.

TI  - Heightened beta EEG activity during nonrapid eye movement sleep in primary insomnia 
      patients with reports of childhood maltreatment.
PG  - 188-98
LID - 10.1097/WNP.0b013e3182767c4a [doi]
AB  - The present study explores the relationship between childhood maltreatment 
      experiences and spectral power in high-frequency EEG activity during sleep in a 
      sample of adults experiencing primary insomnia. Forty-five nontreated patients with 
      primary insomnia spent three consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory, during 
      which polysomnographic recordings were carried out. Nonrapid eye movement and rapid 
      eye movement EEG data were analyzed using spectral analysis. In addition, each 
      participant completed several self-report questionnaires assessing maltreatment in 
      childhood and adolescence, current level of stress, and current depressivity. 
      Insomnia patients with self-reported history of moderate to severe childhood 
      maltreatment (MAL group; n = 25), as measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, 
      were compared with insomnia patients without such a history (non-MAL group; n = 20). 
      The MAL group exhibited more absolute and relative beta 1 and beta 2 power in 
      nonrapid eye movement sleep and more absolute beta 1 and beta 2 activity in rapid 
      eye movement sleep than the non-MAL group. Contrary to hypothesis, no group 
      differences were found in gamma frequency band. The results suggest an association 
      between history of childhood maltreatment and increased beta EEG activity 
      particularly during nonrapid eye movement sleep in adult insomnia, what may reflect 
      heightened psychophysiologic arousal during sleep.

TI  - Altered overnight modulation of spontaneous waking EEG reflects altered sleep 
      homeostasis in major depressive disorder: a high-density EEG investigation.

LID - S0165-0327(13)00463-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2013.05.084 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior investigations have suggested sleep homeostasis is altered in 
      major depressive disorder (MDD). Low frequency activity (LFA) in the 
      electroencephalogram during waking has been correlated with sleep slow wave activity 
      (SWA), suggesting that waking LFA reflects sleep homeostasis in healthy individuals. 
      This study investigated whether the overnight change in waking LFA and its 
      relationship with sleep SWA are altered in MDD. METHODS: 256-channel high-density 
      electroencephalography (hdEEG) recordings during waking (pre- and post-sleep) and 
      during sleep were collected in 14 unmedicated, unipolar MDD subjects (9 women) and 
      age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: Waking LFA (3.25-6.25 Hz) 
      declined significantly overnight in the HC group, but not in the group of MDD 
      subjects. Overnight decline of waking LFA correlated with sleep SWA in frontal brain 
      regions in HC, but a comparable relationship was not found in MDD. LIMITATIONS: This 
      study is not able to definitely segregate overnight changes in the waking EEG that 
      may occur due to homeostatic and/or circadian factors. CONCLUSIONS: MDD involves 
      altered overnight modulation of waking low frequency EEG activity that may reflect 
      altered sleep homeostasis in the disorder. Future research is required to determine 
      the functional significance and clinical implications of these findings.

TI  - Sleep allostasis in chronic sleep restriction: the role of the norepinephrine 
      system.
PG  - 9-16

LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2013.07.048 [doi]
AB  - Sleep responses to chronic sleep restriction may be very different from those 
      observed after acute total sleep deprivation. Specifically, when sleep restriction 
      is repeated for several consecutive days, animals express attenuated compensatory 
      increases in sleep time and intensity during daily sleep opportunities. The 
      neurobiological mechanisms underlying these adaptive, or more specifically, 
      allostatic, changes in sleep homeostasis are unknown. Several lines of evidence 
      indicate that norepinephrine may play a key role in modulating arousal states and 
      NREM EEG delta power, which is widely recognized as a marker for sleep intensity. 
      Therefore, we investigated time course changes in brain adrenergic receptor mRNA 
      levels in response to chronic sleep restriction using a rat model. Here, we observed 
      that significantly altered mRNA levels of the α1- adrenergic receptor in the basal 
      forebrain as well as α2- and β1-adrenergic receptor in the anterior cingulate cortex 
      only on the first sleep restriction day. On the other hand, the frontal cortex α1-, 
      α2-, and β1-adrenergic receptor mRNA levels were reduced throughout the period of 
      sleep restriction. Combined with our earlier findings on EEG that sleep time and 
      intensity significantly increased only on the first sleep restriction days, these 
      results suggest that alterations in the brain norepinephrine system in the basal 
      forebrain and cingulate cortex may mediate allostatic changes in sleep time and 
      intensity observed during chronic sleep restriction.

AB  - Aging is a process that is inevitable, and makes our body vulnerable to age-related 
      diseases. Age is the most consistent factor affecting the sleep structure. 
      Therefore, new automatic sleep staging methods, to be used in both of young and 
      elderly patients, are needed. This study proposes an automatic sleep stage detector, 
      which can separate wakefulness, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) 
      sleep using only EEG and EOG. Most sleep events, which define the sleep stages, are 
      reduced with age. This is addressed by focusing on the amplitude of the clinical EEG 
      bands, and not the affected sleep events. The age-related influences are then 
      reduced by robust subject-specific scaling. The classification of the three sleep 
      stages are achieved by a multi-class support vector machine using the 
      one-versus-rest scheme. It was possible to obtain a high classification accuracy of 
      0.91. Validation of the sleep stage detector in other sleep disorders, such as apnea 
      and narcolepsy, should be considered in future work.

AB  - In order to identify the differences for the onset and progression of functionally 
      distinct cholinergic innervation disorders, we investigated the effect of bilateral 
      nucleus basalis (NB) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) lesions on 
      sleep/wake states and electroencephalographic (EEG) microstructure in rats, 
      chronically implanted for sleep recording. Bilateral NB lesion transiently altered 
      Wake/NREM duration within the sensorimotor cortex, and Wake/REM duration within the 
      motor cortex, while there was no change in the sleep/wake states distributions 
      following the bilateral PPT lesion. Bilateral PPT lesion sustainably increased the 
      Wake/REM and REM/Wake transitions followed by inconsistent dysregulation of the 
      NREM/REM and REM/NREM transitions in sensorimotor cortex, but oppositely by their 
      increment throughout four weeks in motor cortex. Bilateral NB lesion sustainably 
      decreased the NREM/REM and REM/NREM transitions during four weeks in the 
      sensorimotor cortex, but oppositely increased them in the motor cortex. We have 
      shown that the sustained beta and gamma augmentation within the sensorimotor and 
      motor cortex, and across all sleep/wake states, simultaneously with Wake delta 
      amplitude attenuation only within the sensorimotor cortex, were the underlying EEG 
      microstructure for the sleep/wake states transitions structure disturbance following 
      bilateral PPT lesion. In contrast, the bilateral NB lesion only augmented REM theta 
      in sensorimotor cortex during three weeks. We have shown that the NB and PPT lesions 
      induced differing, structure-related EEG microstructure and transition structure 
      disturbances particularly expressed in motor cortex during NREM and REM sleep. We 
      evidenced for the first time the different topographical expression of the 
      functionally distinct cholinergic neuronal innervation impairment in rat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep benefits memory consolidation. Here, we tested the beneficial 
      effect of sleep on memory consolidation following exposure psychotherapy of phobic 
      anxiety. METHOD: A total of 40 individuals afflicted with spider phobia according to 
      DSM-IV underwent a one-session virtual reality exposure treatment and either slept 
      for 90 min or stayed awake afterwards. RESULTS: Sleep following exposure therapy 
      compared with wakefulness led to better reductions in self-reported fear (p = 0.045, 
      d = 0.47) and catastrophic spider-related cognitions (p = 0.026, d = 0.53) during 
      approaching a live spider, both tested after 1 week. Both reductions were associated 
      with greater percentages of stage 2 sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that 
      sleep following successful psychotherapy, such as exposure therapy, improves 
      therapeutic effectiveness, possibly by strengthening new non-fearful memory traces 
      established during therapy. These findings offer an important non-invasive 
      alternative to recent attempts to facilitate therapeutic memory extinction and 
      consolidation processes with pharmacological or behavioral interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide an improved method for the automatic 
      classification of the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) sleep by applying a 
      segmentation technique to the computation of descriptors from the EEG. METHODS: A 
      dataset of 16 polysomnographic recordings from healthy subjects was employed, and 
      the EEG traces underwent first an automatic isolation of NREM sleep portions by 
      means of an Artificial Neural Network and then a segmentation process based on the 
      Spectral Error Measure. The information content of the descriptors was evaluated by 
      means of ROC curves and compared with that of descriptors obtained without the use 
      of segmentation. Finally, the descriptors were used to train a discriminant function 
      for the automatic classification of CAP phases A. RESULTS: A significant improvement 
      with respect to previous scoring methods in terms of both information content 
      carried by the descriptors and accuracy of the classification was obtained. 
      CONCLUSIONS: EEG segmentation proves to be a useful step in the computation of 
      descriptors for CAP scoring. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a complete method for 
      CAP analysis, which is entirely automatic and allows the recognition of A phases 
      with a high accuracy thanks to EEG segmentation.

AB  - Sleep disruption in childhood is associated with clearly defined deficits in 
      neurocognition and behaviour. Childhood eczema is also a potent cause of sleep 
      disruption though it is unknown whether it too results in neurocognitive deficits. 
      To test this hypothesis, neurocognitive (WISC-IV), parental-reported sleep quality 
      (Sleep Disturbance Scale of Children (SDSC)) and overnight polysomnographic (PSG) 
      data were collected in 21 children with eczema and 20 healthy controls (age range 
      6-16 years). Children with eczema had worse sleep quality on both PSG (notably 
      increased nocturnal wakefulness, a higher number of stage shifts and a longer 
      latency to REM onset) and parental report. In addition, they demonstrated 
      significant neurocognitive deficits (especially verbal comprehension, perceptual 
      reasoning and to a lesser extent working memory) with a composite Full Scale IQ 16 
      points lower than controls. Parental reported sleep problems but not PSG parameters 
      were correlated with reduced neurocognitive performance. However, hierarchical 
      regression analyses revealed that eczema status was predictive while sleep 
      fragmentation (parental or PSG) was not predictive of neurocognitive performance. As 
      this is the first study to systematically examine neurocognitive functioning in 
      children with eczema and given the finding of significant deficits it merits 
      replication especially given the prevalence of the condition. The unanswered 
      question is whether these cognitive deficits normalise with effective eczema 
      treatment and if this is mediated by improvements in sleep architecture.

AB  - Sleep disorders in humans have become a public health issue in recent years. Sleep 
      can be analysed by studying the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during a night's 
      sleep. Alternating between sleep-wake stages gives information related to the sleep 
      quality and quantity since this alternating pattern is highly affected during sleep 
      disorders. Spectral composition of EEG signals varies according to sleep stages, 
      alternating phases of high energy associated to low frequency (deep sleep) with 
      periods of low energy associated to high frequency (wake and light sleep). The 
      analysis of sleep in humans is usually made on periods (epochs) of 30-s length 
      according to the original Rechtschaffen and Kales sleep scoring manual. In this 
      work, we propose a new phase space-based (mainly based on Poincaré plot) algorithm 
      for automatic classification of sleep-wake states in humans using EEG data gathered 
      over relatively short-time periods. The effectiveness of our approach is 
      demonstrated through a series of experiments involving EEG data from seven healthy 
      adult female subjects and was tested on epoch lengths ranging from 3-s to 30-s. The 
      performance of our phase space approach was compared to a 2-dimensional state space 
      approach using the power spectral (PS) in two selected human-specific frequency 
      bands. These powers were calculated by dividing integrated spectral amplitudes at 
      selected human-specific frequency bands. The comparison demonstrated that the phase 
      space approach gives better performance in the case of short as well as standard 
      30-s epoch lengths.

AB  - Deep sleep is characterized by slow waves of electrical activity in the cerebral 
      cortex. They represent alternating down states and up states of, respectively, 
      hyperpolarization with accompanying neuronal silence and depolarization during which 
      neuronal firing resumes. The up states give rise to faster oscillations, notably 
      spindles and gamma activity which appear to be of major importance to the role of 
      sleep in brain function and cognition. Unfortunately, while spindles are easily 
      detectable, gamma oscillations are of very small amplitude. No previous sleep study 
      has succeeded in demonstrating modulations of gamma power along the time course of 
      slow waves in human scalp EEG. As a consequence, progress in our understanding of 
      the functional role of gamma modulation during sleep has been limited to animal 
      studies and exceptional human studies, notably those of intracranial recordings in 
      epileptic patients. Because high synaptic density, which peaks some time before 
      puberty depending on the brain region (Huttenlocher and Dabholkar, 1997), generates 
      oscillations of larger amplitude, we considered that the best chance to demonstrate 
      a modulation of gamma power by slow wave phase in regular scalp sleep EEG would be 
      in school-aged children. Sleep EEG was recorded in 30 healthy children (aged 10.7 ± 
      0.8 years; mean ± s.d.). Time-frequency analysis was applied to evaluate the time 
      course of spectral power along the development of a slow wave. Moreover, we 
      attempted to modify sleep architecture and sleep characteristics through automated 
      acoustic stimulation coupled to the occurrence of slow waves in one subset of the 
      children. Gamma power increased on the rising slope and positive peak of the slow 
      wave. Gamma and spindle activity is strongly suppressed during the negative peak. 
      There were no differences between the groups who received and did not receive 
      acoustic stimulation in the sleep parameters and slow wave-locked time-frequency 
      analysis. Our findings show, for the first time in scalp EEG in humans, that gamma 
      activity is associated with the up-going slope and peak of the slow wave. We propose 
      that studies in children provide a uniquely feasible opportunity to conduct 
      investigations into the role of gamma during sleep.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sleep slow wave activity (SWA, EEG power between 1 and 4.5 Hz) is a 
      major characteristic of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which seems to be 
      critically involved in cortical plasticity. Studies using high-density 
      electroencephalography (hd-EEG) showed that the topographical distribution of SWA 
      mirrors cortical maturation, expressing a local maximum that is characteristic for a 
      certain age range. We compared the sleep EEG of children with 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with healthy controls to explore 
      differences in sleep SWA. METHODS: All-night hd-EEG recordings (128 electrodes) were 
      performed in a group of nine children diagnosed with ADHD and nine age- and 
      sex-matched healthy controls. SWA topography was calculated and contrasted between 
      the groups. RESULTS: We found a local increase of SWA in a cluster of six electrodes 
      over central regions in children with ADHD compared to control children (+17% ± 6% 
      SE, p < .01). This group difference was specific for the SWA range and stable across 
      the night. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ADHD showed a less mature topographical SWA 
      distribution in comparison to healthy children of the same age and sex. This 
      neuromaturational delay in ADHD is in accordance with neuroimaging and behavioral 
      studies. Thus, our study supports the use of sleep SWA topography as a reliable 
      imaging tool for the study of cortical plasticity.

AB  - Dreaming occurs during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) 
      sleep, which both are regulated by homeostatic, ultradian, and circadian processes. 
      However, the magnitude of how ultradian REM and NREM sleep and its EEG correlates 
      impact onto dream recall remains fairly unknown. In this review, we address three 
      questions: 1. Is there an ultradian NREM-REM sleep modulation in successful dream 
      recall, which is gated by the circadian clock? 2. What are the key 
      electrophysiological correlates that account for dream recall during NREM and REM 
      sleep and 3. Are there age-related changes in the ultradian and circadian regulation 
      in dream recall and its electrophysiological correlates? Knowledge on the specific 
      frequency and topography NREM and REM sleep differences prior to dream recall may 
      pinpoint to the cerebral correlates that account for this cognitive process, and 
      hint to their possible physiological meaning.

TI  - Sleep in the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and minimally conscious state.
PG  - 339-46
LID - 10.1089/neu.2012.2654 [doi]
AB  - The goal of our study was to investigate different aspects of sleep, namely the 
      sleep-wake cycle and sleep stages, in the vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness 
      syndrome (VS/UWS), and minimally conscious state (MCS). A 24-h polysomnography was 
      performed in 20 patients who were in a UWS (n=10) or in a MCS (n=10) because of 
      brain injury. The data were first tested for the presence of a sleep-wake cycle, and 
      the observed sleep patterns were compared with standard scoring criteria. Sleep 
      spindles, slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep were quantified and their 
      clinical value was investigated. According to our results, an electrophysiological 
      sleep-wake cycle was identified in five MCS and three VS/UWS patients. Sleep stages 
      did not always match the standard scoring criteria, which therefore needed to be 
      adapted. Sleep spindles were present more in patients who clinically improved within 
      6 months. Slow wave sleep was present in eight MCS and three VS/UWS patients but 
      never in the ischemic etiology. Rapid eye movement sleep, and therefore dreaming 
      that is a form of consciousness, was present in all MCS and three VS/UWS patients. 
      In conclusion, the presence of alternating periods of eyes-open/eyes-closed cycles 
      does not necessarily imply preserved electrophysiological sleep architecture in the 
      UWS and MCS, contrary to previous definition. The investigation of sleep is a little 
      studied yet simple and informative way to evaluate the integrity of residual brain 
      function in patients with disorders of consciousness with possible clinical 
      diagnostic and prognostic implications.

TI  - Paradoxical sleep deprivation potentiates epilepsy induced by homocysteine 
      thiolactone in adult rats.
PG  - 77-83
LID - 10.1258/ebm.2012.012154 [doi]
AB  - There is an intriguing and still poorly understood relationship between sleep 
      deprivation and epilepsy. It has recently been shown that paradoxical sleep 
      deprivation decreases levels of homocysteine, an amino acid involved together with 
      its thiolactone metabolite in epileptogenesis. The aim of the present study was to 
      investigate the effects of paradoxical sleep deprivation on homocysteine thiolactone 
      (H)-induced seizures in rats, a model of generalized seizures. Selective deprivation 
      of paradoxical sleep in adult male Wistar rats was achieved by the platform method. 
      Animals with implanted electrodes for electroencephalogram (EEG) registration were 
      assigned to appropriate experimental conditions (dry cage for control, large 
      platform for stress control and small platform for paradoxical sleep deprivation) 
      and 72 h later were intraperitoneally treated with either H (5.5 mmol/kg) or saline 
      (0.9% NaCl). This study showed that paradoxical sleep deprivation increased the 
      incidence and number of H-induced seizure episodes, shortened latency time to 
      seizures and led to significant rates of lethality after H administration, but 
      without effect on the seizure severity. Paradoxical sleep deprivation increased the 
      number and duration of spikes-and-wave discharges, while decreased latency to its 
      appearance in EEG. Judging by the behavioral and EEG findings, it could be concluded 
      that paradoxical sleep deprivation can provoke the expression of factors that can 
      potentiate H-induced seizures in adult rats.

AB  - Age-related differences in sensitivity to the acute effects of alcohol may play an 
      important role in the increased risk for the development of alcoholism seen in teens 
      that begin drinking at an early age. The present study evaluated the acute and 
      protracted (hangover) effects of ethanol in adolescent (P33-P40) and adult 
      (P100-P107) Wistar rats, using the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG). Six minutes 
      of EEG was recorded during waking, 15 min after administration of 0, 1.5, or 3.0 
      g/kg ethanol, and for 3 h at 20 h post ethanol, during the rats' next sleep cycle. 
      Significantly higher overall frontal and parietal cortical power was seen in a wide 
      range of EEG frequencies in adolescent rats as compared to adult rats in their 
      waking EEG. Acute administration of ethanol did not produce differences between 
      adolescents and adults on behavioral measures of acute intoxication. However, it did 
      produce a significantly less intense acute EEG response to ethanol in the theta 
      frequencies in parietal cortex in the adolescents as compared to the adults. At 20 h 
      following acute ethanol administration, during the rats' next sleep cycle, a 
      decrease in slow-wave frequencies (1-4 Hz) was seen and the adolescent rats were 
      found to display more reduction in the slow-wave frequencies than the adults did. 
      The present study found that adolescent rats, as compared to adults, demonstrate low 
      sensitivity to acute ethanol administration in the theta frequencies and more 
      susceptibility to disruption of slow-wave sleep during hangover. These studies may 
      lend support to the idea that these traits may contribute to increased risk for 
      alcohol use disorders seen in adults who begin drinking in their early teenage 
      years.

AB  - Identifying the stages of sleep, or sleep staging, is an unavoidable step in sleep 
      research and typically requires visual inspection of electroencephalography (EEG) 
      and electromyography (EMG) data. Currently, scoring is slow, biased and prone to 
      error by humans and thus is the most important bottleneck for large-scale sleep 
      research in animals. We have developed an unsupervised, fully automated sleep 
      staging method for mice that allows less subjective and high-throughput evaluation 
      of sleep. Fully Automated Sleep sTaging method via EEG/EMG Recordings (FASTER) is 
      based on nonparametric density estimation clustering of comprehensive EEG/EMG power 
      spectra. FASTER can accurately identify sleep patterns in mice that have been 
      perturbed by drugs or by genetic modification of a clock gene. The overall accuracy 
      is over 90% in every group. 24-h data are staged by a laptop computer in 10 min, 
      which is faster than an experienced human rater. Dramatically improving the sleep 
      staging process in both quality and throughput FASTER will open the door to 
      quantitative and comprehensive animal sleep research.

AB  - Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep 
      (EECSWSS) is an age-related childhood condition characterized by epilepsy, cognitive 
      or behavioral impairment, and electroencephalographic abnormality of continuous 
      spike-wave discharges during slow sleep. Continuous spikes and waves during slow 
      sleep (or electrical status epilepticus during sleep) is an electrographic pattern 
      characterized by nearly continuous spike-wave discharges during non-REM sleep, with 
      a frequency of 1.5-3 Hz and usually diffuse and bilateral in distribution. Most 
      authors consider EECSWSS as wide spectrum of epileptic conditions of different 
      origin associated with heterogeneous clinical manifestations and neuropsychological 
      impairment of different severity in close temporal concordance with the appearance 
      of the electroencephalographic pattern of electrical status epilepticus during 
      sleep. The long-term prognosis of this condition is overall poor owing to the 
      persistence of neuropsychological impairment. Therefore, early recognition and 
      effective therapy are necessary to improve long-term prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dissociative disorders encompass a range of symptoms varying from severe 
      absent-mindedness and memory problems to confusion about one's own identity. Recent 
      studies suggest that these symptoms may be the by-products of a labile sleep-wake 
      cycle. METHODS: In the current study, we explored this issue in patients suffering 
      from insomnia (N=46). We investigated whether these patients have raised levels of 
      dissociative symptoms and whether these are related to objective sleep parameters. 
      Patients stayed for at least one night in a specialized sleep clinic, while sleep 
      EEG data were obtained. In addition, they completed self-report measures on 
      dissociative symptoms, psychological problems, and sleep characteristics. RESULTS: 
      Dissociative symptom levels were elevated in patients suffering from insomnia, and 
      were correlated with unusual sleep experiences and poor sleep quality. Longer REM 
      sleep periods and less time spent awake during the night were predictive of 
      dissociation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that insomnia patients 
      have raised dissociative symptom levels and that their dissociative symptoms are 
      related to objective EEG parameters. These findings are important because they may 
      inspire sleep-related treatment methods for dissociative disorders.

AB  - CONTEXT: Sleep deprivation is an underrecognized problem that afflicts our society 
      and can lead to reductions in vitality. However, vitality can be improved by Johrei 
      therapy. We experimented on animals to distinguish the potential benefits of Johrei 
      therapy independent of placebo effects. OBJECTIVES: The central purpose of this 
      study was to explore the sleep-promoting effects of Johrei in mice subjected to 
      sleep interruption. The exploratory aim of the study was to determine the effect of 
      Johrei on sleep as measured by tissue markers in the brain and 
      electroencephalography-derived sleep in sleep-interrupted mice when compared with 
      control mice. DESIGN, INTERVENTION, AND MEASUREMENTS: Mice (n = 45; C57BL/J6) were 
      randomly allocated to one of five study arms with nine animals per arm: Johrei 
      therapy alone, sham controls, negative controls, sleep interruption, and sleep 
      interruption plus Johrei therapy. The amount of sleep was evaluated by measuring 
      proportion of C-fos reactive neurons versus non-C-fos reactive neurons in the medial 
      preoptic area of brain. RESULTS: The proportion of C-fos reactive cells in 
      sleep-interrupted mice that received Johrei therapy (14.5 ± 0.8%; sleep interruption 
      plus Johrei therapy group) was greater than in sleep-interrupted mice (2.4 ± 1.3%; 
      sleep interruption group) that received no such therapy (P < .0001). The sleep 
      efficiency adjusted for baseline sleep in sleep interrupted mice that received 
      Johrei therapy (sleep interruption plus Johrei therapy group; median 115%; 
      interquartile range 68, 134%) was greater than mice receiving sleep interruption 
      alone (sleep interruption group; median 89%; interquartile range 65, 110%; P = .07). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Johrei treatment results in better sleep as measured by proportion of 
      brain tissue markers of recent sleep.

AB  - Respiratory control differs dramatically across sleep stages. Indeed, along with 
      rapid eye movements (REM), respiration was one of the first physiological variables 
      shown to be modulated across sleep stages. The study of sleep stages, their 
      physiological correlates, and neurobiological underpinnings present a challenge 
      because of the fragility and unpredictability of individual stages, not to mention 
      sleep itself. Although anesthesia has often substituted as a model for a unitary 
      stage of slow-wave (non-REM) sleep, it is only recently that urethane anesthesia has 
      been proposed to model the full spectrum of sleep given the presence of spontaneous 
      brain state alternations and concurrent physiological correlates that appear 
      remarkably similar to natural sleep. We describe this model, its parallels with 
      natural sleep, and its power for studying modulation of respiration. Specifically, 
      we report data on the EEG characteristics across brain states under urethane 
      anesthesia, the dependence of brain alternations on neurotransmitter systems, and 
      the observations on state dependent modulation of respiration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the EEG power spectra characteristics of the sleep onset 
      period (SOP) in patients with sleep onset insomnia (SOI), sleep maintenance insomnia 
      (SMI) and good sleepers (GS). METHODS: The time course of EEG power density (1-40Hz) 
      during the SOP was examined in thirty subjects (SOI patients: N=10, SMI patients: 
      N=10, GS: N=10). RESULTS: The EEG power of the beta2 frequency band (18-29.75 Hz) 
      was significantly lower in SOI than in SMI in the period preceding sleep onset. The 
      alpha power was significantly higher for the SMI group compared to GS before sleep 
      onset. Despite the lack of statistical significance, several differences in EEG 
      dynamics were observed in SOI compared to two other groups: delta power increased 
      slower after sleep onset; beta2 and 3 (18-29.75 and 30-39.75 Hz) power decrease less 
      abruptly before sleep onset; beta1 (15-17.75 Hz) power increase through the whole 
      SOP. CONCLUSIONS: The lower level of beta2 frequency band in SOI and the differences 
      in dynamics in delta and beta bands may suggest that a mechanism other than 
      hyperarousal participates in etiology of SOI. SIGNIFICANCE: SOI and SMI patients 
      have different spectral characteristics in SOP, thus future studies should avoid the 
      inclusion of mixed insomnia samples.

TI  - Sleep modifications in acute transient global amnesia.
PG  - 921-7
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.2994 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a temporary memory loss 
      characterized by an abrupt onset of antero-grade and retrograde amnesia, totally 
      reversible. Since sleep plays a major role in memory consolidation, and in the 
      storage of memory-related traces into the brain cortex, the aims of the present 
      study were: (1) to evaluate changes in sleep macro-structure in TGA; (2) to assess 
      modifications in sleep micro-structure in TGA, with particular reference to the 
      arousal EEG and to cyclic alternating pattern (CAP); (3) to compare sleep parameters 
      in TGA patients with a control group of patients with acute ischemic events ("minor 
      stroke" or transient ischemic attack [TIA]) clinically and neuroradiologically 
      "similar" to the TGA. METHODS: TGA GROUP: 17 patients, (8 men and 9 women, 60.2 ± 
      12.5 years). Stroke or TIA (SoT) group: 17 patients hospitalized in the Stroke Unit 
      for recent onset of minor stroke or TIA with hemispheric localization; healthy 
      controls (HC) group: 17 healthy volunteers, matched for age and sex. Patients and 
      controls underwent full-night polysomnography. RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis 
      (conditions TGA, SoT, and HC) a significant effect of the condition was observed for 
      sleep efficiency index, number of awakenings longer 1 min, REM latency, CAP time, 
      and CAP rate. TGA and SoT differed only for CAP time and CAP rate, which were lower 
      in the TGA group. CONCLUSIONS: Microstructural modification associated with tga 
      could be consequent to: (1) hippocampal dysfunction and memory impairment; (2) 
      impairment of arousal-related structures (in particular, cholinergic pathways); (3) 
      emotional distress.

AB  - Exposure to early life stress may profoundly influence the developing brain in 
      lasting ways. Neuropsychiatric disorders associated with early life adversity may 
      involve neural changes reflected in EEG power as a measure of brain activity and 
      disturbed sleep. The main aim of the present study was for the first time to 
      characterize possible changes in adult EEG power after postnatal maternal separation 
      in rats. Furthermore, in the same animals, we investigated how EEG power and sleep 
      architecture were affected after exposure to a chronic mild stress protocol. During 
      postnatal day 2-14 male rats were exposed to either long maternal separation (180 
      min) or brief maternal separation (10 min). Long maternally separated offspring 
      showed a sleep-wake nonspecific reduction in adult EEG power at the frontal EEG 
      derivation compared to the brief maternally separated group. The quality of slow 
      wave sleep differed as the long maternally separated group showed lower delta power 
      in the frontal-frontal EEG and a slower reduction of the sleep pressure. Exposure to 
      chronic mild stress led to a lower EEG power in both groups. Chronic exposure to 
      mild stressors affected sleep differently in the two groups of maternal separation. 
      Long maternally separated offspring showed more total sleep time, more episodes of 
      rapid eye movement sleep and higher percentage of non-rapid eye movement episodes 
      ending in rapid eye movement sleep compared to brief maternal separation. Chronic 
      stress affected similarly other sleep parameters and flattened the sleep homeostasis 
      curves in all offspring. The results confirm that early environmental conditions 
      modulate the brain functioning in a long-lasting way.

TI  - A role for cortical nNOS/NK1 neurons in coupling homeostatic sleep drive to EEG slow 
      wave activity.
PG  - 20272-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1314762110 [doi]
AB  - Although the neural circuitry underlying homeostatic sleep regulation is little 
      understood, cortical neurons immunoreactive for neuronal nitric oxide synthase 
      (nNOS) and the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1) have been proposed to be involved in this 
      physiological process. By systematically manipulating the durations of sleep 
      deprivation and subsequent recovery sleep, we show that activation of cortical 
      nNOS/NK1 neurons is directly related to non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time, 
      NREM bout duration, and EEG δ power during NREM sleep, an index of preexisting 
      homeostatic sleep drive. Conversely, nNOS knockout mice show reduced NREM sleep 
      time, shorter NREM bouts, and decreased power in the low δ range during NREM sleep, 
      despite constitutively elevated sleep drive. Cortical NK1 neurons are still 
      activated in response to sleep deprivation in these mice but, in the absence of 
      nNOS, they are unable to up-regulate NREM δ power appropriately. These findings 
      support the hypothesis that cortical nNOS/NK1 neurons translate homeostatic sleep 
      drive into up-regulation of NREM δ power through an NO-dependent mechanism.

TI  - Homology, correspondence, and continuity across development: the case of sleep.
PG  - 92-100
LID - 10.1002/dev.21024 [doi]
AB  - The causal relationships among developing behaviors can take many forms. At one 
      extreme, two behaviors may emerge independently of one another and, at the other 
      extreme, the emergence of one behavior may depend on the prior emergence of the 
      other. Whether the two behaviors in the latter case should be designated as 
      developmentally homologous is explored in this essay by reviewing differing 
      approaches to conceptualizing the development of sleep. It is argued that whereas 
      the concept of developmental homology may offer little new to the understanding of 
      sleep development, the conventional notion of evolutionary homology remains to be 
      fully exploited. Identifying homologous sleep processes will benefit from the 
      adoption of a developmental comparative approach that emphasizes real-time sleep 
      dynamics and individual sleep components. Because evolution occurs through the 
      modification of developmental processes, a new commitment to a developmental 
      comparative approach to sleep is a necessary next step toward a better understanding 
      of its evolution.

AB  - The current clinical standard for quantifying sleep physiology is the laboratory 
      polysomnogram, from which basic sleep-wake stages are determined. However, the 
      complexity of sleep physiology has inspired alternative metrics that are providing 
      additional insights into the rich dynamics of sleep. Electro-encephalography, 
      magneto-encephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging represent 
      advanced imaging modalities for understanding brain dynamics. These methods are 
      complemented by autonomic measurements that provide additional important insights. 
      We review here the spectrum of approaches that have been leveraged towards improved 
      understanding of the complexity of sleep.

AB  - This paper examines nonlinear effects in a neural field model of the corticothalamic 
      system to predict the EEG power spectrum of sleep spindles. Nonlinearity in the 
      thalamic relay nuclei gives rise to a spindle harmonic visible in the cortical EEG. 
      By deriving an analytic expression for nonlinear spectrum, the power in the spindle 
      harmonic is predicted to scale quadratically with the power in the spindle 
      oscillation. By isolating sleep spindles from background sleep in experimental EEG 
      data, the spindle harmonic is directly observed.

AB  - Different kinds of challenge can alter spontaneous ongoing electroencephalographic 
      (EEG) rhythms in animal models, thus providing paradigms to evaluate treatment 
      effects in drug discovery. The effects of challenges represented by pharmacological 
      agents, hypoxia, sleep deprivation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on 
      EEG rhythms are here reviewed to build a knowledge platform for innovative 
      translational models for drug discovery in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been 
      reported that antagonists of cholinergic neurotransmission cause synchronisation of 
      spontaneous ongoing EEG rhythms in terms of enhanced power of EEG low frequencies 
      and decreased power of EEG high frequencies. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and 
      serotonergic drugs may restore a normal pattern of EEG desynchronisation. Sleep 
      deprivation and hypoxia challenges have also been reported to elicit abnormal 
      synchronisation of spontaneous ongoing EEG rhythms in rodents. The feasibility and 
      reproducibility of TMS have been demonstrated in rodents but information on a 
      consistent modulation of EEG after TMS manipulation is very limited. Transgenic mice 
      over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein complementary DNAs (cDNAs) 
      harbouring the 'Swedish' mutation and PS-1 cDNAs harbouring the A264E mutation, 
      which recapitulate some of the pathological features of AD, exhibit alterations of 
      spontaneous ongoing EEG rhythms at several low and high frequencies. This does not 
      appear, however, to be a consequence of beta-amyloid deposition in the brain. The 
      present review provides a critical evaluation of changes of spontaneous ongoing EEG 
      rhythms due to the experimental manipulations described above, in order to stimulate 
      the promote more adherent models fitting dynamics in humans.

AB  - Although a growing body of research indicates that frequent nightmares are related 
      to impaired sleep regulation, the pathophysiology of nightmare disorder is far from 
      being fully understood. We examined the relative spectral power values for NREM and 
      REM sleep separately in 19 individuals with nightmare disorder and 21 healthy 
      controls, based on polysomnographic recordings of the second nights' laboratory 
      sleep. Nightmare subjects compared to controls exhibited increased relative high 
      alpha (10-14.5Hz) and fronto-central increases in high delta (3-4Hz) power during 
      REM sleep, and a trend of increased fronto-central low alpha (7.75-9Hz) power in 
      NREM sleep. These differences were independent of the confounding effects of waking 
      emotional distress. High REM alpha and low NREM alpha powers were strongly related 
      in nightmare but not in control subjects. The topographical distribution and 
      spectral components of REM alpha activity suggest that nightmare disordered subjects 
      are characterized by wake-like electroencephalographic features during REM sleep.

TI  - Sleep enhances inhibitory behavioral control in discrimination learning in rats.
PG  - 1469-77
LID - 10.1007/s00221-013-3797-5 [doi]
AB  - Sleep supports the consolidation of memory, and it has been proposed that this 
      enhancing effect of sleep pertains in particular to memories which are encoded under 
      control of prefrontal-hippocampal circuitry into an episodic memory system. 
      Furthermore, repeated reactivation and transformation of such memories during sleep 
      are thought to promote the de-contextualization of these memories. Here, we aimed to 
      establish a behavioral model for the study of such sleep-dependent system 
      consolidation in rats, using a go/nogo conditional discrimination learning task 
      known to essentially depend on prefrontal-hippocampal function. Different groups of 
      rats were trained to criterion on this task and, then, subjected to 80-min retention 
      intervals filled with spontaneous morning sleep, sleep deprivation, or spontaneous 
      evening wakefulness. In a subsequent test phase, the speed of relearning of the 
      discrimination task was examined as indicator of memory, whereby rats were either 
      tested in the same context as during training or in a different context. Sleep 
      promoted relearning of the conditional discrimination task, and this effect was 
      similar for testing memory in the same or different context (p < 0.001). Independent 
      of sleep and wakefulness during the retention interval, animals showed faster 
      relearning when tested in the same context as during learning, compared with testing 
      in a different context (p < 0.001). The benefitting effect of sleep on 
      discrimination learning was primarily due to an enhancing effect on response 
      suppression during the nogo stimulus. We infer from these results that sleep 
      enhances memory for inhibitory behavioral control in a generalized 
      context-independent manner and thereby might eventually also contribute to the 
      abstraction of schema-like representations.

TI  - Reduced sleep and low adenosinergic sensitivity in cacna1a R192Q mutant mice.
PG  - 127-36
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2316 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Adenosine modulates sleep via A(1) and A(2A) receptors. As the 
      A(1) receptor influences Ca(V)2.1 channel functioning via G-protein inhibition, 
      there is a possible role of the Ca(V)2.1 channel in sleep regulation. To this end we 
      investigated transgenic Cacna1a R192Q mutant mice that express mutant Ca(V)2.1 
      channels that are less susceptible to inhibition by G-proteins. We hypothesized that 
      Cacna1a R192Q mice could show reduced susceptibility to adenosine, which may result 
      in a sleep phenotype characterized by decreased sleep. DESIGN: R192Q mutant and 
      littermate wild-type mice were subjected to a 6-h sleep deprivation, treatment with 
      caffeine (a non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist which induces waking), or 
      cyclopentyladenosine (CPA, an A(1) receptor specific agonist which induces sleep). 
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Under baseline conditions, Cacna1a R192Q mice showed more 
      waking with longer waking episodes in the dark period and less non-rapid eye 
      movement (NREM) sleep, but equal amounts of REM sleep compared to wild-type. After 
      treatment with caffeine R192Q mice initiated sleep 30 min earlier than wild-type, 
      whereas after CPA treatment, R192Q mice woke up 260 min earlier than wild-type. Both 
      results indicate that Cacna1a R192Q mice are less susceptible to adenosinergic 
      input, which may explain the larger amount of waking under undisturbed baseline 
      conditions. CONCLUSION: We here show that adenosinergic sleep induction, and 
      responses to caffeine and CPA, are modified in the R192Q mutant in a manner 
      consistent with decreased susceptibility to inhibition by adenosine. The data 
      suggest that the A(1) receptor modulates sleep via the Ca(V)2.1 channel.

TI  - Sleep/wake dependent changes in cortical glucose concentrations.
PG  - 79-89
LID - 10.1111/jnc.12063 [doi]
AB  - Most of the energy in the brain comes from glucose and supports glutamatergic 
      activity. The firing rate of cortical glutamatergic neurons, as well as cortical 
      extracellular glutamate levels, increase with time spent awake and decline 
      throughout non rapid eye movement sleep, raising the question whether glucose levels 
      reflect behavioral state and sleep/wake history. Here chronic (2-3 days) 
      electroencephalographic recordings in the rat cerebral cortex were coupled with 
      fixed-potential amperometry to monitor the extracellular concentration of glucose 
      ([gluc]) on a second-by-second basis across the spontaneous sleep-wake cycle and in 
      response to 3 h of sleep deprivation. [Gluc] progressively increased during non 
      rapid eye movement sleep and declined during rapid eye movement sleep, while during 
      wake an early decline in [gluc] was followed by an increase 8-15 min after 
      awakening. There was a significant time of day effect during the dark phase, when 
      rats are mostly awake, with [gluc] being significantly lower during the last 3-4 h 
      of the night relative to the first 3-4 h. Moreover, the duration of the early phase 
      of [gluc] decline during wake was longer after prolonged wake than after 
      consolidated sleep. Thus, the sleep/wake history may affect the levels of glucose 
      available to the brain upon awakening.

TI  - Altered sleep regulation in a mouse model of SCN1A-derived genetic epilepsy with 
      febrile seizures plus (GEFS+).
PG  - 625-34

AB  - PURPOSE: Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene SCN1A are 
      responsible for a number of epilepsy disorders, including genetic epilepsy with 
      febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and Dravet syndrome. In addition to seizures, patients 
      with SCN1A mutations often experience sleep abnormalities, suggesting that SCN1A may 
      also play a role in the neuronal pathways involved in the regulation of sleep. 
      However, to date, a role for SCN1A in the regulation of sleep architecture has not 
      been directly examined. To fill this gap, we tested the hypothesis that SCN1A 
      contributes to the regulation of sleep architecture, and by extension, that SCN1A 
      dysfunction contributes to the sleep abnormalities observed in patients with SCN1A 
      mutations. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry we first examined the expression of 
      mouse Scn1a in regions of the mouse brain that are known to be involved in seizure 
      generation and sleep regulation. Next, we performed detailed analysis of sleep and 
      wake electroencephalography (EEG) patterns during 48 continuous hours of baseline 
      recordings in a knock-in mouse line that expresses the human SCN1A GEFS+ mutation 
      R1648H (RH mutants). We also characterized the sleep-wake pattern following 6 h of 
      sleep deprivation. KEY FINDINGS: Immunohistochemistry revealed broad expression of 
      Scn1a in the neocortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamic reticular nuclei, dorsal 
      raphe nuclei, pedunculopontine, and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei. Co-localization 
      between Scn1a immunoreactivity and critical cell types within these regions was also 
      observed. EEG analysis under baseline conditions revealed increased wakefulness and 
      reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep amounts 
      during the dark phase in the RH mutants, suggesting a sleep deficit. Nevertheless, 
      the mutants exhibited levels of NREM and REM sleep that were generally similar to 
      wild-type littermates during the recovery period following 6 h of sleep deprivation. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: These results establish a direct role for SCN1A in the regulation of 
      sleep and suggest that patients with SCN1A mutations may experience chronic 
      alterations in sleep, potentially leading to negative outcomes over time. In 
      addition, the expression of Scn1a in specific cell types/brain regions that are 
      known to play critical roles in seizure generation and sleep now provides a 
      mechanistic basis for the clinical features (seizures and sleep abnormalities) 
      associated with human SCN1A mutations.

AB  - Sleep analysis is an important diagnostic tool for sleep disorders. However, the 
      current manual sleep scoring is time-consuming as it is a crude discretization in 
      time and stages. This study changes Esbroeck and Westover's [1] latent sleep staging 
      model into a global model. The proposed data-driven method trained a topic mixture 
      model on 10 control subjects and was applied on 10 other control subjects, 10 iRBD 
      patients and 10 Parkinson's patients. In that way 30 topic mixture diagrams were 
      obtained from which features reflecting distinct sleep architectures between control 
      subjects and patients were extracted. Two features calculated on basis of two latent 
      sleep states classified subjects as "control" or "patient" by a simple clustering 
      algorithm. The mean sleep staging accuracy compared to classical AASM scoring was 
      72.4% for control subjects and a clustering of the derived features resulted in a 
      sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 80 %. This study demonstrates that frequency 
      analysis of sleep EEG can be used for data-driven global sleep classification and 
      that topic features separates iRBD and Parkinson's patients from control subjects.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the success of chloral hydrate (CH) and hydroxyzine 
      on sedation and assess the changes of these drugs on sleep EEG recordings. METHOD: 
      Three hundred and forty-one patients (mean age: 60.92±53.81months) that were 
      uncooperative with the EEG setup or referred for sleep EEG were enrolled in the 
      study. Patients, partially sleep-deprived the night before, were firstly tried to 
      fall on sleep without any medication, the patients who could not sleep spontaneously 
      were randomly divided in two groups of hydroxyzine and chloral hydrate. RESULTS: In 
      147 (43%) of cases, CH was given for sedation. In 112 (32%) hydroxyzine and in 8% of 
      cases CH and hydroxyzine were given. 17% of children had spontaneous sleep. The 
      doses of drugs prescribed were as follows: hydroxyzine 1.43±0.74mg/kg CH 
      38±14.73mg/kg. The time to go on a sleep was 34.68±30.75min in hydroxyzine and 
      32.34±26.83min in CH group (p>0.05). Eighty-nine percent of cases who were sedated 
      with CH and 89.6% of cases who sedated with hydroxyzine were able to sleep (p>0.05). 
      The background rhythm was faster with CH compared to hydroxyzine (p<0.05). There 
      were no association between the occurrence of fast background rhythm and the doses 
      of CH. CONCLUSION: The study described the clinical practice of sedation with CH and 
      hydroxyzine on EEG recording. Data suggest that CH with low doses and hydroxyzine is 
      equally effective for sleep induction, but the side effects of CH on the sleep EEG 
      is much more prominent.

TI  - The relationship of sleep with temperature and metabolic rate in a hibernating 
      primate.
PG  - e69914

LID - e69914
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: It has long been suspected that sleep is important for regulating 
      body temperature and metabolic-rate. Hibernation, a state of acute hypothermia and 
      reduced metabolic-rate, offers a promising system for investigating those 
      relationships. Prior studies in hibernating ground squirrels report that, although 
      sleep occurs during hibernation, it manifests only as non-REM sleep, and only at 
      relatively high temperatures. In our study, we report data on sleep during 
      hibernation in a lemuriform primate, Cheirogaleus medius. As the only primate known 
      to experience prolonged periods of hibernation and as an inhabitant of more 
      temperate climates than ground squirrels, this animal serves as an alternative model 
      for exploring sleep temperature/metabolism relationships that may be uniquely 
      relevant to understanding human physiology. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We find that 
      during hibernation, non-REM sleep is absent in Cheirogaleus. Rather, periods of REM 
      sleep occur during periods of relatively high ambient temperature, a pattern 
      opposite of that observed in ground squirrels. Like ground squirrels, however, EEG 
      is marked by ultra-low voltage activity at relatively low metabolic-rates. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm a sleep-temperature/metabolism link, though they 
      also suggest that the relationship of sleep stage with temperature/metabolism is 
      flexible and may differ across species or mammalian orders. The absence of non-REM 
      sleep suggests that during hibernation in Cheirogaleus, like in the ground squirrel, 
      the otherwise universal non-REM sleep homeostatic response is greatly curtailed or 
      absent. Lastly, ultra-low voltage EEG appears to be a cross-species marker for 
      extremely low metabolic-rate, and, as such, may be an attractive target for research 
      on hibernation induction.

      of sleep).
PG  - 235-7
LID - 10.1097/WNP.0b013e31827681a3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In contrast to EEG, which has guidelines for interpretation and a plethora 
      of textbooks, the full range of activity seen in magnetoencephalography (MEG) has 
      not been fleshed out. Currently, magnetoencephalographers apply criteria for EEG 
      waveforms to MEG signals based on an assumption that MEG activity should have 
      morphology that is similar to EEG. The purpose of this article was to show the 
      characteristic MEG profile of positive occipital sharp transients of sleep. METHODS: 
      Simultaneous MEG-EEG recordings of two cases are shown. RESULTS: In both the cases, 
      the morphologic features of positive occipital sharp transients of sleep in MEG vary 
      and sometimes mimic epileptic spikes. CONCLUSION: This report raises a caution that 
      a normal variant may have an even more epileptic appearance on MEG than on EEG. 
      Using the simultaneously recorded EEG to avoid misinterpretation of spikey-looking 
      positive occipital sharp transients of sleep in MEG is a natural and prudent 
      practice.

TI  - Does sleep restore the topology of functional brain networks?
PG  - 487-500
LID - 10.1002/hbm.21455 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have shown that healthy anatomical as well as functional brain 
      networks have small-world properties and become less optimal with brain disease. 
      During sleep, the functional brain network becomes more small-world-like. Here we 
      test the hypothesis that the functional brain network during wakefulness becomes 
      less optimal after sleep deprivation (SD). Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded 
      five times a day after a night of SD and after a night of normal sleep in eight 
      young healthy subjects, both during eyes-closed and eyes-open resting state. Overall 
      synchronization was determined with the synchronization likelihood (SL) and the 
      phase lag index (PLI). From these coupling strength matrices the normalized 
      clustering coefficient C (a measurement of local clustering) and path length L (a 
      measurement of global integration) were computed. Both measures were normalized by 
      dividing them by their corresponding C-s and L-s values of random control networks. 
      SD reduced alpha band C/C-s and L/L-s and theta band C/C-s during eyes-closed 
      resting state. In contrast, SD increased gamma-band C/C-s and L/L-s during eyes-open 
      resting state. Functional relevance of these changes in network properties was 
      suggested by their association with sleep deprivation-induced performance deficits 
      on a sustained attention simple reaction time task. The findings indicate that SD 
      results in a more random network of alpha-coupling and a more ordered network of 
      gamma-coupling. The present study shows that SD induces frequency-specific changes 
      in the functional network topology of the brain, supporting the idea that sleep 
      plays a role in the maintenance of an optimal functional network.

TI  - Quantitative electroencephalography within sleep/wake states differentiates GABAA 
      modulators eszopiclone and zolpidem from dual orexin receptor antagonists in rats.
PG  - 2401-8
LID - 10.1038/npp.2013.139 [doi]
AB  - Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) induce sleep by blocking orexin 1 and 
      orexin 2 receptor-mediated activities responsible for regulating wakefulness. DORAs 
      represent a potential alternative mechanism to the current standard of care that 
      includes the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor-positive allosteric modulators, 
      eszopiclone and zolpidem. This work uses an innovative method to analyze 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral frequencies within sleep/wake states to 
      differentiate the effects of GABAA modulators from DORA-22, an analog of the DORA 
      MK-6096, in Sprague-Dawley rats. The effects of low, intermediate, and high doses of 
      eszopiclone, zolpidem, and DORA-22 were examined after first defining each 
      compound's ability to promote sleep during active-phase dosing. The EEG spectral 
      frequency power within specific sleep stages was calculated in 1-Hz intervals from 1 
      to 100 Hz within each sleep/wake state for the first 4 h after the dose. Eszopiclone 
      and zolpidem produced marked, dose-responsive disruptions in sleep stage-specific 
      EEG spectral profiles compared with vehicle treatment. In marked contrast, DORA-22 
      exhibited marginal changes in the spectral profile, observed only during rapid eye 
      movement sleep, and only at the highest dose tested. Moreover, while eszopiclone- 
      and zolpidem-induced changes were evident in the inactive period, the EEG spectral 
      responses to DORA-22 were absent during this phase. These results suggest that 
      DORA-22 differs from eszopiclone and zolpidem whereby DORA-22 promotes somnolence 
      without altering the neuronal network EEG activity observed during normal sleep.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between indices of sleep spindle 
      activity and cognitive performance in a sample of healthy children. DESIGN: 
      Correlational. Intelligence (Stanford-Binet) and neurocognitive functioning (NEPSY) 
      were assessed, with sleep variables being measured during overnight polysomnography. 
      SETTING: Hospital sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven healthy children 
      (mean age 8.19 y; 14 female, 13 male). INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: 
      Participants underwent a single night of overnight polysomnography after completing 
      measures of intelligence and neurocognitive functioning. Sleep spindles were 
      visually identified by an experienced sleep scoring technician and separated 
      algorithmically into fast (> 13 Hz) and slow spindle (< 13 Hz) categories. The 
      number of fast spindles was significantly correlated with narrative memory (r(s) = 
      0.38) and sensorimotor functioning (-0.43). Mean central frequency of spindles was 
      also significantly correlated with sensorimotor functioning (-0.41), planning 
      ability (-0.41), and working memory (-0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Basal sleep spindle 
      activity is associated with different aspects of cognitive performance in children. 
      To the extent that these associations in a pediatric population are different from 
      what is known in adult sleep may play an important role in development.

AB  - Sleep is strongly conserved within species, yet marked and perplexing 
      inter-individual differences in sleep physiology are observed. Combining EEG sleep 
      recordings and high-resolution structural brain imaging, here we demonstrate that 
      the morphology of the human brain offers one explanatory factor of such 
      inter-individual variability. Gray matter volume in interoceptive and exteroceptive 
      cortices correlated with the expression of slower NREM sleep spindle frequencies, 
      supporting their proposed role in sleep protection against conscious perception. 
      Conversely, and consistent with an involvement in declarative memory processing, 
      gray matter volume in bilateral hippocampus was associated with faster NREM sleep 
      spindle frequencies. In contrast to spindles, gray matter volume in the homeostatic 
      sleep-regulating center of the basal forebrain/hypothalamus, together with the 
      medial prefrontal cortex, accounted for individual differences in NREM slow wave 
      oscillations. Together, such findings indicate that the qualitative and quantitative 
      expression of human sleep physiology is significantly related to anatomically 
      specific differences in macroscopic brain structure.

AB  - Sleep fragmentation is present in numerous sleep pathologies and constitutes a major 
      feature of patients with obstructive sleep apnea. A prevalence of metabolic 
      syndrome, diabetes and obesity has been shown to be associated to obstructive sleep 
      apnea. While sleep fragmentation has been shown to impact sleep homeostasis, its 
      specific effects on metabolic variables are only beginning to emerge. In this 
      context, it is important to develop realistic animal models that would account for 
      chronic metabolic effects of sleep fragmentation. We developed a 14-day model of 
      instrumental sleep fragmentation in mice, and show an impact on both brain-specific 
      and general metabolism. We first report that sleep fragmentation increases food 
      intake without affecting body weight. This imbalance was accompanied by the 
      inability to adequately decrease brain temperature during fragmented sleep. In 
      addition, we report that sleep-fragmented mice develop glucose intolerance. We also 
      observe that sleep fragmentation slightly increases the circadian peak level of 
      glucocorticoids, a factor that may be involved in the observed metabolic effects. 
      Our results confirm that poor-quality sleep with sustained sleep fragmentation has 
      similar effects on general metabolism as actual sleep loss. Altogether, these 
      results strongly suggest that sleep fragmentation is an aggravating factor for the 
      development of metabolic dysfunctions that may be relevant for sleep disorders such 
      as obstructive sleep apnea.

AB  - This study presents a novel approach for the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal 
      quantification in which the empirical mode decomposition method, a time-frequency 
      method designated for nonlinear and non-stationary signals, decomposes the EEG 
      signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) with corresponding frequency ranges that 
      characterize the appropriate oscillatory modes embedded in the brain neural activity 
      acquired using EEG. To calculate the instantaneous frequency of IMFs, an algorithm 
      was developed using the Generalized Zero Crossing method. From the resulting 
      frequencies, two different novel features were generated: the median instantaneous 
      frequencies and the number of instantaneous frequency changes during a 30s segment 
      for seven IMFs. The sleep stage classification for the daytime sleep of 20 healthy 
      babies was determined using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm. The 
      results were evaluated using the cross-validation method to achieve an approximately 
      90% accuracy and with new examinee data to achieve 80% average accuracy of 
      classification. The obtained results were higher than the human experts' agreement 
      and were statistically significant, which positioned the method, based on the 
      proposed features, as an efficient procedure for automatic sleep stage 
      classification. The uniqueness of this study arises from newly proposed features of 
      the time-frequency domain, which bind characteristics of the sleep signals to the 
      oscillation modes of brain activity, reflecting the physical characteristics of 
      sleep, and thus have the potential to highlight the congruency of twin pairs with 
      potential implications for the genetic determination of sleep.

TI  - Enhancing sleep quality and memory in insomnia using instrumental sensorimotor 
      rhythm conditioning.

AB  - EEG recordings over the sensorimotor cortex show a prominent oscillatory pattern in 
      a frequency range between 12 and 15 Hz (sensorimotor rhythm, SMR) under quiet but 
      alert wakefulness. This frequency range is also abundant during sleep, and overlaps 
      with the sleep spindle frequency band. In the present pilot study we tested whether 
      instrumental conditioning of SMR during wakefulness can enhance sleep and cognitive 
      performance in insomnia. Twenty-four subjects with clinical symptoms of primary 
      insomnia were tested in a counterbalanced within-subjects-design. Each patient 
      participated in a SMR- as well as a sham-conditioning training block. 
      Polysomnographic sleep recordings were scheduled before and after the training 
      blocks. Results indicate a significant increase of 12-15 Hz activity over the course 
      of ten SMR training sessions. Concomitantly, the number of awakenings decreased and 
      slow-wave sleep as well as subjective sleep quality increased. Interestingly, 
      SMR-training enhancement was also found to be associated with overnight memory 
      consolidation and sleep spindle changes indicating a beneficial cognitive effect of 
      the SMR training protocol for SMR "responders" (16 out of 24 participants). Although 
      results are promising it has to be concluded that current results are of a 
      preliminary nature and await further proof before SMR-training can be promoted as a 
      non-pharmacological approach for improving sleep quality and memory performance.

AB  - Recent findings suggest that sleep might serve a role in emotional coping. However, 
      most findings are based on subjective reports of sleep quality, while the relation 
      with underlying sleep physiology is still largely unknown. In this study, the impact 
      of an emotionally distressing experience on the EEG correlates of sleep was 
      assessed. In addition, the association between sleep physiological parameters and 
      the extent of emotional attenuation over sleep was determined. The experimental set 
      up involved presentation of an emotionally neutral or distressing film fragment in 
      the evening, followed by polysomnographic registration of undisturbed, whole-night 
      sleep and assessment of emotional reactivity to film cues on the next evening. We 
      found that emotional distress induced mild sleep deterioration, but also an increase 
      in the proportion of slow wave sleep (SWS) and altered patterning of rapid eye 
      movement (REM) sleep. Indeed, while REM sleep occurrence normally increases over the 
      course of the night, emotional distress flattened this distribution and correlated 
      with an increased number of REM periods. While sleep deterioration was negatively 
      associated to emotional attenuation over sleep, the SWS response was positively 
      related to such attenuation and may form part of a compensatory response to the 
      stressor. Interestingly, trait-like SWS characteristics also correlated positively 
      with the extent of emotion attenuation over sleep. The combined results provide 
      strong evidence for an intimate reciprocal relation between sleep physiology and 
      emotional processing. Moreover, individual differences in subjects' emotional and 
      sleep responses suggest there may be a coupling of certain emotion and sleep traits 
      into distinct emotional sleep types.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the use of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) scaling 
      exponent of the awake electroencephalogram (EEG) as a new alternative biomarker of 
      neurobehavioural impairment and sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 
      METHODS: Eight patients with moderate-severe OSA and nine non-OSA controls underwent 
      a 40-h extended wakefulness challenge with resting awake EEG, neurobehavioural 
      performance (driving simulator and psychomotor vigilance task) and subjective 
      sleepiness recorded every 2-h. The DFA scaling exponent and power spectra of the EEG 
      were calculated at each time point and their correlation with sleepiness and 
      performance were quantified. RESULTS: DFA scaling exponent and power spectra 
      biomarkers significantly correlated with simultaneously tested performance and 
      self-rated sleepiness across the testing period in OSA patients and controls. 
      Baseline (8am) DFA scaling exponent but not power spectra were markers of impaired 
      simulated driving after 24-h extended wakefulness in OSA (r=0.738, p=0.037). OSA 
      patients had a higher scaling exponent and delta power during wakefulness than 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: The DFA scaling exponent of the awake EEG performed as well 
      as conventional power spectra as a marker of impaired performance and sleepiness 
      resulting from sleep loss. SIGNIFICANCE: DFA may potentially identify patients at 
      risk of neurobehavioural impairment and assess treatment effectiveness.

TI  - Local experience-dependent changes in the wake EEG after prolonged wakefulness.
PG  - 59-72
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2302 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Prolonged wakefulness leads to a progressive increase in sleep 
      pressure, reflected in a global increase in slow wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4.5 Hz) in 
      the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG). A global increase in wake theta activity (5-9 
      Hz) also occurs. Recently, it was shown that prolonged wakefulness in rodents leads 
      to signs of "local sleep" in an otherwise awake brain, accompanied by a slow/theta 
      wave (2-6 Hz) in the local EEG that occurs at different times in different cortical 
      areas. Compelling evidence in animals and humans also indicates that sleep is 
      locally regulated by the amount of experience-dependent plasticity. Here, we asked 
      whether the extended practice of tasks that involve specific brain circuits results 
      in increased occurrence of local intermittent theta waves in the human EEG, above 
      and beyond the global EEG changes previously described. DESIGN: Participants 
      recorded with high-density EEG completed 2 experiments during which they stayed 
      awake ≥ 24 h practicing a language task (audiobook listening [AB]) or a visuomotor 
      task (driving simulator [DS]). SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: 
      16 healthy participants (7 females). INTERVENTIONS: Two extended wake periods. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Both conditions resulted in global increases in resting 
      wake EEG theta power at the end of 24 h of wake, accompanied by increased 
      sleepiness. Moreover, wake theta power as well as the occurrence and amplitude of 
      theta waves showed regional, task-dependent changes, increasing more over left 
      frontal derivations in AB, and over posterior parietal regions in DS. These local 
      changes in wake theta power correlated with similar local changes in sleep low 
      frequencies including SWA. CONCLUSIONS: Extended experience-dependent plasticity of 
      specific circuits results in a local increase of the wake theta EEG power in those 
      regions, followed by more intense sleep, as reflected by SWA, over the same areas.

AB  - Fronto-limbic brain activity during sleep is believed to support the consolidation 
      of emotional memories in healthy adults. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD) is accompanied by emotional deficits coincidently caused by dysfunctional 
      interplay of fronto-limbic circuits. This study aimed to examine the role of sleep 
      in the consolidation of emotional memory in ADHD in the context of healthy 
      development. 16 children with ADHD, 16 healthy children, and 20 healthy adults 
      participated in this study. Participants completed an emotional picture recognition 
      paradigm in sleep and wake control conditions. Each condition had an immediate 
      (baseline) and delayed (target) retrieval session. The emotional memory bias was 
      baseline-corrected, and groups were compared in terms of sleep-dependent memory 
      consolidation (sleep vs. wake). We observed an increased sleep-dependent emotional 
      memory bias in healthy children compared to children with ADHD and healthy adults. 
      Frontal oscillatory EEG activity (slow oscillations, theta) during sleep correlated 
      negatively with emotional memory performance in children with ADHD. When combining 
      data of healthy children and adults, correlation coefficients were positive and 
      differed from those in children with ADHD. Since children displayed a higher frontal 
      EEG activity than adults these data indicate a decline in sleep-related 
      consolidation of emotional memory in healthy development. In addition, it is 
      suggested that deficits in sleep-related selection between emotional and 
      non-emotional memories in ADHD exacerbate emotional problems during daytime as they 
      are often reported in ADHD.

AB  - PURPOSE: To define atypical clinical and EEG features of patients with subacute 
      sclerosing panencephalitis that may require an overview of differential diagnosis. 
      METHODS: A total of 66 EEGs belonging to 53 (17 females and 36 males) consecutive 
      patients with serologically confirmed subacute sclerosing panencephalitis were 
      included in this study. Patient files and EEG data were evaluated retrospectively. 
      EEGs included in the study were sleep-waking EEGs and/or sleep-waking video-EEG 
      records with at least 2 hours duration. Cranial MRIs of the patients taken 2 months 
      before or after the EEG records were included. RESULTS: Age range at the onset of 
      the disease was 15 to 192 months (mean age: 80.02 months). Epilepsy was diagnosed in 
      21 (43%) patients. Among epileptic seizures excluding myoclonic jerks, generalized 
      tonic-clonic type constituted the majority (58%). Tonic seizures were documented 
      during the video-EEG recordings in four patients. Epileptogenic activities were 
      found in 56 (83%) EEG recordings. They were localized mainly in frontal (58%), 
      posterior temporal, parietal, occipital (26%), and centrotemporal (8%) regions. 
      Multiple foci were detected in 26 recordings (39%). Epileptiform activities in the 
      39 (59%) EEGs appeared as unilateral or bilateral diffuse paroxysmal discharges. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of uncommon clinical and EEG findings of subacute 
      sclerosing panencephalitis, especially in countries where subacute sclerosing 
      panencephalitis has not been eliminated yet, could be helpful in prevention of 
      misdiagnosis and delay in the management of improvable conditions.

AB  - In rat models of absence epilepsy, epileptic spike-wave discharges appeared in EEG 
      spontaneously, and the incidence of epileptic activity increases with age. 
      Spike-wave discharges and sleep spindles are known to share common thalamo-cortical 
      mechanism, suggesting that absence seizures might affect some intrinsic properties 
      of sleep spindles. This paper examines time-frequency EEG characteristics of 
      anterior sleep spindles in non-epileptic Wistar and epileptic WAG/Rij rats at the 
      age of 7 and 9 months. Considering non-stationary features of sleep spindles, EEG 
      analysis was performed using Morlet-based continuous wavelet transform. It was 
      found, first, that the average frequency of sleep spindles in non-epileptic Wistar 
      rats was higher than in WAG/Rij (13.2 vs 11.2 Hz). Second, the instantaneous 
      frequency ascended during a spindle event in Wistar rats, but it was constant in 
      WAG/Rij. Third, in WAG/Rij rats, the number and duration of epileptic discharges 
      increased in a period between 7 and 9 months of age, but duration and mean value of 
      intra-spindle frequency did not change. In general, age-dependent aggravation of 
      absence seizures in WAG/Rij rats did not affect EEG properties of sleep spindles; it 
      was suggested that pro-epileptic changes in thalamo-cortical network in WAG/Rij rats 
      might prevent dynamic changes of sleep spindles that were detected in Wistar.

AB  - Manual scoring of sleep spindles can be very time-consuming, and achieving accurate 
      manual scoring on a long-term recording requires high and sustained levels of 
      vigilance, which makes it a highly demanding task with the associated risk of 
      decreased diagnosis accuracy. Although automatic spindle detection would be 
      attractive, most available algorithms are sensitive to variations in spindle 
      amplitude and frequency that occur between both subjects and derivations, reducing 
      their effectiveness. We propose here an algorithm that models the 
      amplitude-frequency spindle distribution with a bivariate normal distribution (one 
      normal model per derivation). Subsequently, spindles are detected when their 
      amplitude-frequency characteristics are included within a given tolerance interval 
      of the corresponding model. As a consequence, spindle detection is not directly 
      based on amplitude and frequency thresholds, but instead on a spindle distribution 
      model that is automatically adapted to each individual subject and derivation. The 
      algorithm was first assessed against the scoring of one sleep scoring expert on EEG 
      samples from seven healthy children. Afterward, a second study compared performance 
      of two additional experts versus the algorithm on a dataset of six EEG samples from 
      adult patients suffering from different pathologies, to submit the method to more 
      challenging and clinically realistic conditions. Smaller and shorter spindles were 
      more difficult to evaluate, as false positives and false negatives showed lower 
      amplitude and smaller length than true positives. In both studies, normal modelling 
      enhanced performance compared to fixed amplitude and frequency thresholds. Normal 
      modelling is therefore attractive, as it enhances spindle detection quality.

AB  - Understanding the inherent dynamics of the EEG associated to sleep-waking can 
      provide insights into its basic neural regulation. By characterizing the local 
      properties of the EEG using power spectrum, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and 
      Hilbert-spectral analysis, we can examine the dynamics over a range of time-scales. 
      We analyzed rat EEG during wake, NREMS and REMS using these methods. The average 
      instantaneous phase, power spectral density (PSD) of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) 
      and the energy content in various frequency bands show characteristic changes in 
      each of the vigilance states. The 2nd and 7th IMFs show changes in PSD for wake and 
      REMS, suggesting that those modes may carry wake- and REMS-associated cognitive, 
      conscious and behavior-specific information of an individual even though the EEG may 
      appear similar. The energy content in θ2 (6 Hz-9 Hz) band of the 1st IMF for REMS is 
      larger than that of wake. The decrease in the phase function of IMFs from wake to 
      REMS to NREMS indicates decrease of the mean frequency in these states, 
      respectively. The rate of information processing in waking state is more in the time 
      scale described by the first three IMFs than in REMS state. However, for IMF5-IMF7, 
      the rate is more for REMS than that for wake. We obtained Hilbert-Huang spectral 
      entropy, which is a suitable measure of information processing in each of these 
      state-specific EEG. It is possible to evaluate the complex dynamics of the EEG in 
      each of the vigilance states by applying measures based on EMD and 
      Hilbert-transform. Our results suggest that the EMD based nonlinear measures of the 
      EEG can provide useful estimates of the information possessed by various 
      oscillations associated with the vigilance states. Further, the EMD-based spectral 
      measures may have implications in understanding anatamo-physiological correlates of 
      sleep-waking behavior and clinical diagnosis of sleep-pathology.

AB  - Brain state alternations resembling those of sleep spontaneously occur in rats under 
      urethane anesthesia and they are closely linked with sleep-like respiratory changes. 
      Although rats are a common model for both sleep and respiratory physiology, we 
      sought to determine if similar brain state and respiratory changes occur in mice 
      under urethane. We made local field potential recordings from the hippocampus and 
      measured respiratory activity by means of EMG recordings in intercostal, 
      genioglossus, and abdominal muscles. Similar to results in adult rats, urethane 
      anesthetized mice displayed quasi-periodic spontaneous forebrain state alternations 
      between deactivated patterns resembling slow wave sleep (SWS) and activated patterns 
      resembling rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These alternations were associated with 
      an increase in breathing rate, respiratory variability, a depression of inspiratory 
      related activity in genioglossus muscle and an increase in expiratory-related 
      abdominal muscle activity when comparing deactivated (SWS-like) to activated 
      (REM-like) states. These results demonstrate that urethane anesthesia consistently 
      induces sleep-like brain state alternations and correlated changes in respiratory 
      activity across different rodent species. They open up the powerful possibility of 
      utilizing transgenic mouse technology for the advancement and translation of 
      knowledge regarding sleep cycle alternations and their impact on respiration.

AB  - Sex differences in spontaneous sleep amount are largely dependent on reproductive 
      hormones; however, in mice some sex differences in sleep amount during the active 
      phase are preserved after gonadectomy and may be driven by non-hormonal factors. In 
      this study, we sought to determine whether or not these sex differences are driven 
      by sex chromosome complement. Mice from the four core genotype (FCG) mouse model, 
      whose sex chromosome complement (XY, XX) is independent of phenotype (male or 
      female), were implanted with electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic 
      (EMG) electrodes for the recording of sleep-wake states and underwent a 24-hr 
      baseline recording followed by six hours of forced wakefulness. During baseline 
      conditions in mice whose gonads remained intact, males had more total sleep and 
      non-rapid eye movement sleep than females during the active phase. Gonadectomized 
      FCG mice exhibited no sex differences in rest-phase sleep amount; however, during 
      the mid-active-phase (nighttime), XX males had more spontaneous non-rapid eye 
      movement (NREM) sleep than XX females. The XY mice did not exhibit sex differences 
      in sleep amount. Following forced wakefulness there was a change in the factors 
      regulating sleep. XY females slept more during their mid-active phase siestas than 
      XX females and had higher NREM slow wave activity, a measure of sleep propensity. 
      These findings suggest that the process that regulates sleep propensity is 
      sex-linked, and that sleep amount and sleep propensity are regulated differently in 
      males and females following sleep loss.

TI  - Topographic and sex-related differences in sleep spindles in major depressive 
      disorder: a high-density EEG investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep spindles are believed to mediate several sleep-related functions 
      including maintaining disconnection from the external environment during sleep, 
      cortical development, and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Prior studies that 
      have examined sleep spindles in major depressive disorder (MDD) have not 
      demonstrated consistent differences relative to control subjects, which may be due 
      to sex-related variation and limited spatial resolution of spindle detection. Thus, 
      this study sought to characterize sleep spindles in MDD using high-density 
      electroencephalography (hdEEG) to examine the topography of sleep spindles across 
      the cortex in MDD, as well as sex-related variation in spindle topography in the 
      disorder. METHODS: All-night hdEEG recordings were collected in 30 unipolar MDD 
      participants (19 women) and 30 age and sex-matched controls. Topography of sleep 
      spindle density, amplitude, duration, and integrated spindle activity (ISA) were 
      assessed to determine group differences. Spindle parameters were compared between 
      MDD and controls, including analysis stratified by sex. RESULTS: As a group, MDD 
      subjects demonstrated significant increases in frontal and parietal spindle density 
      and ISA compared to controls. When stratified by sex, MDD women demonstrated 
      increases in frontal and parietal spindle density, amplitude, duration, and ISA; 
      whereas MDD men demonstrated either no differences or decreases in spindle 
      parameters. LIMITATIONS: Given the number of male subjects, this study may be 
      underpowered to detect differences in spindle parameters in male MDD participants. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates topographic and sex-related differences in 
      sleep spindles in MDD. Further research is warranted to investigate the role of 
      sleep spindles and sex in the pathophysiology of MDD.

AB  - Juvenile myclonic epilepsy (JME) can be firmly diagnosed by a careful interview of 
      the patient focusing on the seizures and by the EEG with the help, if necessary, of 
      long-term video-EEG monitoring using sleep and/or sleep deprivation. Background 
      activity is normal. The interictal EEG shows diffuse or generalized spike-wave (SW) 
      and polyspike-wave (PSW) discharges. In some patients, non-specific changes or 
      misleading features such as focal changes are found. Changes are mostly seen at 
      sleep onset and at awakening. Provoked awakenings are more likely to activate 
      interictal paroxysmal abnormalities than spontaneous awakenings. The presence of a 
      photoparoxysmal response with or without myoclonic jerks (MJ) is common (30% of the 
      cases). Myoclonic jerks are associated with a discharge of fast, irregular, 
      generalized PSWs that predominate anteriorly. Myoclonic jerks appear to be 
      associated with rhythmic EEG (spike) potentials at around 20Hz. These frequencies 
      are in the range of movement-related fast sensorimotor cortex physiological rhythms. 
      The application of jerk-locked averaging technique has provided findings consistent 
      with a cortical origin of MJ. Paired TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) studies 
      showed a defective intracortical inhibition, due to impaired GABA-A mediated 
      mechanisms. In this review, we present the EEG characteristics of JME with 
      particular emphasis on the pathophysiology of MJ and on the role of sleep 
      deprivation on interictal and ictal changes.

TI  - Period-amplitude analysis reveals wake-dependent changes in the electroencephalogram 
      during sleep deprivation.
PG  - 1723-35
LID - 10.5665/sleep.3138 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Electroencephalographic slow wave activity (SWA) during non-rapid 
      eye movement (NREM) sleep results from the synchronous oscillation of cortical 
      neurons and is the standard measurement of sleep homeostasis. SWA is not a direct 
      measure of sleep pressure accumulation, but rather a measure of the NREM-sleep 
      response to accumulated sleep pressure. Currently, no practical standard for the 
      direct measurement of sleep pressure accumulation exists. Recently, it was 
      demonstrated that rat cortical neurons undergo oscillations during wake that are 
      similar to the cortical oscillations responsible for SWA. Furthermore, these 
      oscillations increase in number as time awake increases. Here we hypothesize that 
      period-amplitude analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), which treats the EEG as 
      a series of discrete waves, can measure these cortical oscillations, and thus, is a 
      measure of sleep-pressure accumulation during extended wake. DESIGN: Mice were sleep 
      deprived for 24 h by confinement to a slowly rotating wheel in order to assess 
      wake-dependent changes in EEG wave incidence. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Continuous 
      period-amplitude analysis of the waking EEG across 24 h of sleep deprivation 
      revealed that the incidence of 2 to 6 Hz waves increased exponentially over the 
      deprivation period. This increase in wave incidence appeared to occur in two phases 
      with exponential time constants of approximately 0.12 h and 3 h. Further analysis 
      revealed that the changes in wave incidence were significantly correlated with two 
      established markers of sleep pressure, SWA and NREM sleep latency. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      data suggest that wave incidence is an effective method of measuring sleep 
      homeostasis in the waking EEG that provides better temporal resolution than spectral 
      power analysis.

TI  - Pain and the alpha-sleep anomaly: a mechanism of sleep disruption in 
      facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 487-97
LID - 10.1111/pme.12054 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the presence of the alpha-sleep anomaly in facioscapulohumeral 
      muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and to evaluate the association between the sleep 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern and the presence of musculoskeletal pain. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. SUBJECTS: Fifty-five consecutive 
      adult FSHD patients, 26 women and 29 men, age 49.6 ± 15.1 years (range 18-76). 
      INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires and polysomnography. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were 
      asked to indicate if in the 3 months before the sleep study they presented 
      persisting or recurring musculoskeletal pain. Patients who reported pain were asked 
      to fill in the Italian version of the Brief Pain Inventory and the McGill Pain 
      questionnaire, and a 101-point visual analog scale (VAS) for pain intensity. 
      Polysomnographic recordings were performed. EEG was analyzed by means of Fast 
      Fourier Transform. Four power spectra bands (δ 0-4 Hz, θ 4-8 Hz, α 8-14 Hz, β 
      14-32 Hz) were computed. Sleep macrostructure parameters and alpha/delta EEG power 
      ratio during non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were compared between patients with 
      and without pain. RESULTS: Forty-two patients in our sample reported chronic pain. 
      VAS mean score was 55.2 ± 23.8 (range 10-100), pain rating index score was 
      13.8 ± 10.2, and present pain intensity was 2.5 ± 0.8. The statistical analysis 
      documented an increased occurrence of the alpha and beta rhythms during NREM sleep 
      in FSHD patients with pain. Significant correlations were observed between the 
      alpha/delta power ratio during NREM sleep and pain measures. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic 
      musculoskeletal pain is frequent in FSHD patients, and it represents a major 
      mechanism of sleep disruption.

TI  - Heart rate variability in sleep-related migraine without aura.
PG  - 707-14
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.2846 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This is an observational study aimed to investigate the activity of 
      autonomic nervous system during sleep in patients with sleep-related migraine. 
      METHODS: Eight consecutive migraineurs without aura were enrolled (6 women and 2 
      men), aged 30 to 62 years (mean 48.1 ± 9.3 years). Inclusion criteria were: high 
      frequency of attacks (> 5 per month) and occurrence of more than 75% of the attacks 
      during sleep causing an awakening. Patients were compared with a control group of 55 
      healthy subjects (23 men and 32 women, mean age 54.2 ± 13.0 years), and with a 
      further control group of 8 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Patient and 
      controls underwent polysomnography and heart rate variability analysis. RESULTS: A 
      significant reduction of the LF/HF ratio during N2 and N3 sleep stages was observed 
      in migraineurs compared with controls. No differences in sleep macrostructure were 
      observed; cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) time and CAP rate were lower in 
      migraineurs than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a peculiar 
      modification of the autonomic balance during sleep in sleep-related migraine. The 
      reduction of LF/HF ratio in NREM sleep was observed in controls, but it was 
      quantitatively much more evident in migraineurs. Changes in LF/HF could be 
      consequent to an autonomic unbalance which could manifest selectively (or 
      alternatively become more evident) during sleep. These findings, together with the 
      reduction in CAP rate, could be an expression of reduced arousability during sleep 
      in patients with sleep-related migraine. The simultaneous involvement of the 
      autonomic, arousal, and pain systems might suggest involvement of the hypothalamic 
      pathways.

TI  - Unstable sleep and higher sympathetic activity during late-sleep periods of rats: 
      implication for late-sleep-related higher cardiovascular events.
PG  - 108-18

AB  - We proposed that the higher incidence of sleep fragmentation, sympathovagal 
      imbalance and baroreceptor reflex impairment during quiet sleep may play a critical 
      role in late-sleep-related cardiovascular events. Polysomnographic recording was 
      performed through wireless transmission using freely moving Wistar-Kyoto rats over 
      24 h. The low-frequency power of arterial pressure variability was quantified to 
      provide an index of vascular sympathetic activity. Spontaneous baroreflex 
      sensitivity was assessed by slope of arterial pressure-RR linear regression. As 
      compared with early-light period (Zeitgeber time 0-6 h), rats during the late-light 
      period (Zeitgeber time 6-12 h) showed lower accumulated quiet sleep time and higher 
      paradoxical sleep time; furthermore, during quiet sleep, the rats showed a lower δ% 
      of electroencephalogram, more incidents of interruptions, higher σ% and higher β% of 
      electroencephalogram, raised low-frequency power of arterial pressure variability 
      value and lower baroreflex sensitivity parameters. During the light period, 
      low-frequency power of arterial pressure variability during quiet sleep had a 
      negative correlation with accumulated quiet sleep time and δ% of 
      electroencephalogram, while it also had a positive correlation with σ% and β% of 
      electroencephalogram and interruption events. However, late-sleep-related raised 
      sympathetic activity and sleep fragmentation diminished when an α1-adrenoceptor 
      antagonist was given to the rats. Our results suggest that the higher incidence of 
      sleep fragmentation and sympathovagal imbalance during quiet sleep may play a 
      critical role in late-sleep-related cardiovascular events. Such sleep fragmentation 
      is coincident with an impairment of baroreflex sensitivity, and is mediated via 
      α1-adernoceptors.

TI  - Sleep and the single neuron: the role of global slow oscillations in individual cell 
      rest.
PG  - 443-51
LID - 10.1038/nrn3494 [doi]
AB  - Sleep is universal in animals, but its specific functions remain elusive. We propose 
      that sleep's primary function is to allow individual neurons to perform prophylactic 
      cellular maintenance. Just as muscle cells must rest after strenuous exercise to 
      prevent long-term damage, brain cells must rest after intense synaptic activity. We 
      suggest that periods of reduced synaptic input ('off periods' or 'down states') are 
      necessary for such maintenance. This in turn requires a state of globally 
      synchronized neuronal activity, reduced sensory input and behavioural immobility - 
      the well-known manifestations of sleep.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could 
      be predicted algorithmically by means of recurrence analysis of the sleep-staged 
      electroencephalogram (EEG). METHODS: A randomly selected cohort of 20 sleep-staged 
      patients with OSA (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 5-30) was divided into mild and 
      moderate sub-cohorts (AHI 5-15, 16-30, respectively), and the sleep EEG (C3) was 
      analyzed using analysis of brain recurrence (ABR) (LSU cohort). Twenty distinct but 
      related markers for sleep depth and fragmentation were computed from four ABR 
      variables, and a marker function capable of classifying each patient into one of the 
      two sub-cohorts was determined by linear discriminant analysis. Classification 
      accuracy of individual patients was evaluated using area under the receiver operator 
      characteristics curve (AUROC). As a control procedure, 20 additional sleep-staged 
      patients with OSA whose polysomnographic data was obtained from an independent 
      database were also evaluated (SHHS cohort). RESULTS: On average, markers for sleep 
      depth were reduced and those for sleep fragmentation were increased in the patients 
      with moderate OSA, as expected. All patients in both cohorts were correctly 
      classified using as few as 5-6 markers. SIGNIFICANCE: The degree of severity of OSA 
      was reflected in objective changes in the sleep EEG. Recurrence analysis of the EEG 
      potentially has uses beyond identification of the degree of OSA.

TI  - Essential thalamic contribution to slow waves of natural sleep.
PG  - 19599-610
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3169-13.2013 [doi]
AB  - Slow waves represent one of the prominent EEG signatures of non-rapid eye movement 
      (non-REM) sleep and are thought to play an important role in the cellular and 
      network plasticity that occurs during this behavioral state. These slow waves of 
      natural sleep are currently considered to be exclusively generated by intrinsic and 
      synaptic mechanisms within neocortical territories, although a role for the thalamus 
      in this key physiological rhythm has been suggested but never demonstrated. 
      Combining neuronal ensemble recordings, microdialysis, and optogenetics, here we 
      show that the block of the thalamic output to the neocortex markedly (up to 50%) 
      decreases the frequency of slow waves recorded during non-REM sleep in freely 
      moving, naturally sleeping-waking rats. A smaller volume of thalamic inactivation 
      than during sleep is required for observing similar effects on EEG slow waves 
      recorded during anesthesia, a condition in which both bursts and single action 
      potentials of thalamocortical neurons are almost exclusively dependent on T-type 
      calcium channels. Thalamic inactivation more strongly reduces spindles than slow 
      waves during both anesthesia and natural sleep. Moreover, selective excitation of 
      thalamocortical neurons strongly entrains EEG slow waves in a narrow frequency band 
      (0.75-1.5 Hz) only when thalamic T-type calcium channels are functionally active. 
      These results demonstrate that the thalamus finely tunes the frequency of slow waves 
      during non-REM sleep and anesthesia, and thus provide the first conclusive evidence 
      that a dynamic interplay of the neocortical and thalamic oscillators of slow waves 
      is required for the full expression of this key physiological EEG rhythm.

PG  - 223-7
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2012-303578 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) remains an important diagnostic 
      tool in the diagnosis of hypersomnias. However, a positive MSLT may be found in 
      other sleep disorders, such as behaviourally induced inadequate sleep syndrome 
      (BIISS). It has been demonstrated that in sleep onset rapid eye movement (SOREM) 
      periods in BIISS, REM sleep tends to arise from stage 2 sleep (non-REM (NREM) 2), 
      rather than stage 1 sleep (NREM1), as in narcolepsy. METHODS: We performed sleep 
      stage sequence analysis on 127 patients with nocturnal polysomnography and MSLT, 
      including 25 with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C), 41 with narcolepsy without 
      cataplexy (N-C), 21 with idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time (IHL), 20 with 
      BIISS and 20 with periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). 537 naps were recorded, 
      containing 176 SOREM periods. RESULTS: All SOREM periods in the IHL, BIISS and PLMD 
      groups arose from NREM2 sleep, 75% of those in N+C arose from NREM1 and in N-C only 
      52% arose from NREM1. Within the N-C group, those with SOREM periods all arising 
      from stage 1 had a shorter MSL (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 
      SOREM periods arising from NREM1 have high sensitivity for the diagnosis of 
      narcolepsy and that SOREM periods from NREM1 are a marker of severity, either of 
      sleepiness or REM instability. Sleep stage sequence analysis of SOREM periods may 
      also aid more accurate phenotyping of the hypersomnias and in particular clarify 
      heterogeneity among patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy.

TI  - [Measurement of acetylcholine and sleep patterns].
PG  - 21-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acetylcholine is an essential neurotransmitter in the central nervous 
      system as it has an effect on sleep, memory and learning. Intracerebral 
      microdialysis is an in vivo surgical technique that is used to measure the 
      concentration of substances in the extracellular space. METHODS: The rats were 
      stereotaxically implanted with microdialysis cannulae guided to the hypothalamic 
      medial preoptic area and bipolar stainless steel electrodes to obtain sleep records 
      simultaneously with microdialysis samplings during 24 hours exposed to clean air 
      followed by 24 hours of exposure to ozone. Microdialysis fractions were injected 
      into chromatograph system. RESULTS: Results showed that paradoxical sleep and 
      wakefulness decreased by 54.2% and 27.9%, respectively, while slow wave sleep 
      increased by 35.1% during the ozone exposure phase and a concomitant decrease of 
      extracellular acetylcholine of 56.2% was observed during the light-dark phase. 
      CONCLUSION: That surgical method employed using electroencephalography and 
      intracerebral microdialysis allows the quantification of extracellular acetylcholine 
      and simultaneously with patterns related to sleep. We propose that the decrease in 
      paradoxical sleep is the behavioral expression of disruptions of cholinergic 
      modulation and, that post-exposure effects observed in the hypothalamic medial 
      preoptic area can be explained on the basis of the hypothalamic role in the 
      sleep-wake cycle.

AB  - We investigated nocturnal sleep abnormalities in 19 patients with idiopathic 
      hypersomnia without long sleep time (IH) in comparison with two age- and sex- 
      matched control groups of 13 normal subjects (C) and of 17 patients with narcolepsy 
      with cataplexy (NC), the latter considered as the extreme of excessive daytime 
      sleepiness (EDS). Sleep macro- and micro- (i.e. cyclic alternating pattern, CAP) 
      structure as well as quantitative analysis of EEG, of periodic leg movements during 
      sleep (PLMS), and of muscle tone during REM sleep were compared across groups. IH 
      and NC patients slept more than C subjects, but IH showed the highest levels of 
      sleep fragmentation (e.g. awakenings), associated with a CAP rate higher than NC 
      during lighter sleep stages and lower than C during slow wave sleep respectively, 
      and with the highest relative amount of A3 and the lowest of A1 subtypes. IH showed 
      a delta power in between C and NC groups, whereas muscle tone and PLMS had normal 
      characteristics. A peculiar profile of microstructural sleep abnormalities may 
      contribute to sleep fragmentation and, possibly, EDS in IH.

AB  - GABA transporter subtype 1 (GAT1) constructs high affinity reuptake sites for GABA 
      in the CNS and regulates GABAergic transmission. Compounds that inhibit GAT1 are 
      targets often used for the treatment of epilepsy; however sedation has been reported 
      as a side effect of these agents, indicating potential sedative and/or hypnotic uses 
      for these compounds. In the current study, we observed the sleep behaviors of mice 
      treated with NO-711, a selective GAT1 inhibitor, in order to elucidate the role of 
      GAT1 in sleep-wake regulation during the active phase. The data revealed that NO-711 
      at a high dose of 10 mg/kg caused a marked enhancement of EEG activity in the 
      frequency ranges of 3-25 Hz during wakefulness as well as rapid eye movement (REM) 
      sleep. During the non-REM (NREM) sleep, NO-711 (10 mg/kg) elevated EEG activity in 
      the frequency ranges of 1.5-6.75 Hz. Similar changes were found in mice treated with 
      a low dose of 3 mg/kg. NO-711 administered i.p. at a dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg 
      significantly shortened the sleep latency of NREM sleep, increased the amount of 
      NREM sleep and the number of NREM sleep episodes. NO-711 did not affect the sleep 
      latency and the amount of REM sleep. NO-711 dose-dependently increased c-Fos 
      expression in sleep-promoting nucleus of the ventrolateral preoptic area and median 
      preoptic area. However, c-Fos expression was decreased in the wake-promoting nuclei, 
      tuberomammillary nucleus and lateral hypothalamus. These results indicate that 
      NO-711 can increase NREM sleep in mice.

TI  - Intellectual disabilities and power spectra analysis during sleep: a new perspective 
      on borderline intellectual functioning.
PG  - 421-9
LID - 10.1111/jir.12036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of sleep in cognitive processes has been confirmed by a growing 
      number of reports for all ages of life. Analysing sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      spectra may be useful to study cortical organisation in individuals with Borderline 
      Intellectual Functioning (BIF), as seen in other disturbances even if it is not 
      considered a disease. The aim of this study was to determine if the sleep EEG power 
      spectra in children with BIF could be different from typically developing children. 
      METHODS: Eighteen BIF (12 males) (mean age 11.04; SD ± 1.07) and 24 typical 
      developing children (14 men) (mean age 10.98; SD ± 1.76; P = 0.899) underwent an 
      overnight polysomnography (PSG) recording in the Sleep Laboratory of the Clinic of 
      Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry, after one adaptation night. Sleep was 
      subdivided into 30-s epochs and sleep stages were scored according to the standard 
      criteria and the power spectra were calculated for the Cz-A2 channel using the sleep 
      analysis software Hypnolab 1.2 (SWS Soft, Italy) by means of the Fast Fourier 
      Transform and the power spectrum was calculated for frequencies between 0.5 and 60 
      Hz with a frequency step of 1 Hz and then averaged across the following bands delta 
      (0.5-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-11 Hz), sigma (11-15 Hz), and beta (16-30 Hz), 
      gamma (30-60 Hz) for S2, SWS and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep stages. RESULTS: BIF 
      have a reduced sleep duration (total sleep time; P < 0.001), and an increased rate 
      of stage shifts (P < 0.001) and awakenings (P < 0.001) and WASO (wakefulness after 
      sleep onset) % (P < 0.001); the stage 2% (P < 0.001), and REM% (P < 0.001) were 
      lower and slow-wave sleep percentage was slightly higher (P < 0.001). All children 
      with BIF had an AHI (apnoea-hypopnea index) less than 1 (mean AHI = 0.691 ± 0.236) 
      with a mean oxygen saturation of 97.6% and a periodic leg movement index (PLMI) less 
      than 5 (mean PLMI = 2.94 ± 1.56). All sleep stages had a significant reduction in 
      gamma frequency (30-60 Hz) (P < 0.001) and an increased delta frequency (0.5-4.0 Hz) 
      (P < 0.001) power in BIF subjects compared with typically developing children. 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings shed light on the importance of sleep for cognition 
      processes particularly in cognitive borderline dysfunction and the role of EEG 
      spectral power analysis to recognize sleep characteristics in BIF children.

TI  - Partial sleep deprivation by environmental noise increases food intake and body 
      weight in obesity-resistant rats.
PG  - 1396-405
LID - 10.1002/oby.20182 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep restriction in humans increases risk for obesity, but previous 
      rodent studies show weight loss following sleep deprivation, possibly due to 
      stressful methods used to prevent sleep. Obesity-resistant (OR) rats exhibit 
      consolidated-sleep and resistance to weight gain. It was hypothesized that sleep 
      disruption by a less-stressful method would increase body weight, and the effect of 
      partial sleep deprivation (PSD) on body weight in OR and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats 
      was examined. DESIGN AND METHODS: OR and SD rats (n = 12/group) were implanted with 
      transmitters to record sleep/wake. After baseline recording, six SD and six OR rats 
      underwent 8 h PSD during light phase for 9 days. Sleep was reduced using recordings 
      of random noise. Sleep/wake states were scored as wakefulness (W), slow-wave-sleep 
      (SWS), and rapid-eye-movement-sleep (REMS). Total number of transitions between 
      stages, SWS-delta-power, food intake, and body weight were documented. RESULTS: 
      Exposure to noise decreased SWS and REMS time, while increasing W time. 
      Sleep-deprivation increased the number of transitions between stages and 
      SWS-delta-power. Further, PSD during the rest phase increased recovery sleep during 
      the active phase. The PSD SD and OR rats had greater food intake and body weight 
      compared to controls CONCLUSIONS: PSD by less-stressful means increases body weight 
      in rats. Also, PSD during the rest phase increases active period sleep.

PG  - 105-24
LID - 10.1007/s10827-013-0489-x [doi]
AB  - This work presents a probabilistic method for mapping human sleep 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) signals onto a state space based on a biologically 
      plausible mathematical model of the cortex. From a noninvasive EEG signal, this 
      method produces physiologically meaningful pathways of the cortical state over a 
      night of sleep. We propose ways in which these pathways offer insights into 
      sleep-related conditions, functions, and complex pathologies. To address explicitly 
      the noisiness of the EEG signal and the stochastic nature of the mathematical model, 
      we use a probabilistic Bayesian framework to map each EEG epoch to a distribution of 
      likelihoods over all model sleep states. We show that the mapping produced from 
      human data robustly separates rapid eye movement sleep (REM) from slow wave sleep 
      (SWS). A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is incorporated to improve the path results using 
      the prior knowledge that cortical physiology has temporal continuity.

AB  - Nutritional state in the gestation period influences fetal growth and development. 
      We hypothesized that undernutrition during gestation would affect offspring sleep 
      architecture and/or homeostasis. Pregnant female mice were assigned to either 
      control (fed ad libitum; AD) or 50% dietary restriction (DR) groups from gestation 
      day 12 to parturition. After parturition, dams were fed AD chow. After weaning, the 
      pups were also fed AD into adulthood. At adulthood (aged 8-9 weeks), we carried out 
      sleep recordings. Although offspring mice displayed a significantly reduced body 
      weight at birth, their weights recovered three days after birth. Enhancement of

      (NREM) sleep was observed in the DR mice over a 24-hour period without changing the 
      diurnal pattern or amounts of wake, NREM, or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In 
      addition, DR mice also displayed an enhancement of EEG-SWA rebound after a 6-hour 
      sleep deprivation and a higher threshold for waking in the face of external stimuli. 
      DR adult offspring mice exhibited small but significant increases in the expression 
      of hypothalamic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (Pparα) and 
      brain-specific carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1c) mRNA, two genes involved in 
      lipid metabolism. Undernutrition during pregnancy may influence sleep homeostasis, 
      with offspring exhibiting greater sleep pressure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the relationship between the time course of 
      slow wave EEG activity (SWA) during NREM sleep and insulin sensitivity in 
      adolescents. METHODS: Nine normal weight and nine overweight (BMI>85th percentile) 
      adolescents (13-18 years of age) participated. None of the participants had a 
      history of sleep disordered breathing, confirmed by sleep study. Participants 
      maintained a regularized sleep wake cycle for five days followed by overnight 
      polysomnography in the lab or at home. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was 
      administered after a 12h fast and within two weeks of the sleep study. Whole body 
      insulin sensitivity (WBISI) and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) determined 
      insulin resistance. Power spectral analysis quantified slow-wave EEG activity 
      (.05-3.9 Hz) and exponential regression evaluated SWA across successive NREM 
      periods. RESULTS: Those who were insulin resistant and had low insulin sensitivity 
      had less Stages 2, 3 and 4 of NREM sleep, more Stage 1, but did not sleep less than 
      those with low resistance and high sensitivity. SWA power was significantly lower in 
      the first NREM period and the decay rate of SWA across NREM sleep was significantly 
      slower in the low insulin sensitivity group. Similar results were obtained after 
      removing the influence of BMI and Tanner score. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin sensitivity in 
      adolescents is related to SWA power and its time course, not total sleep time, 
      regardless of BMI.

AB  - Shift work and trans-time zone travel lead to insufficient sleep and numerous 
      pathologies. Here, we examined sleep/wake dynamics during chronic exposure to 
      environmental circadian disruption (ECD), and if chronic partial sleep loss 
      associated with ECD influences the induction of shift-related inflammatory disorder. 
      Sleep and wakefulness were telemetrically recorded across three months of ECD, in 
      which the dark-phase of a light-dark cycle was advanced weekly by 6 h. A three month 
      regimen of ECD caused a temporary reorganization of sleep (NREM and REM) and wake 
      processes across each week, resulting in an approximately 10% net loss of sleep each 
      week relative to baseline levels. A separate group of mice were subjected to ECD or 
      a regimen of imposed wakefulness (IW) aimed to mimic sleep amounts under ECD for one 
      month. Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) was quantified in sleep-wake regulatory areas: the 
      nucleus accumbens (NAc), basal forebrain (BF), and medial preoptic area (MnPO). To 
      assess the inflammatory response, trunk blood was treated with lipopolysaccharide 
      (LPS) and subsequent release of IL-6 was measured. Fos-IR was greatest in the NAc, 
      BF, and MnPO of mice subjected to IW. The inflammatory response to LPS was elevated 
      in mice subjected to ECD, but not mice subjected to IW. Thus, the net sleep loss 
      that occurs under ECD is not associated with a pathological immune response.

AB  - The T-cell derived cytokine CD40 ligand is overexpressed in patients with autoimmune 
      diseases. Through activation of its receptor, CD40 ligand leads to a tumor necrosis 
      factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR1) dependent impairment of locomotor activity in mice. 
      Here we report that this effect is explained through a promotion of sleep, which was 
      specific to non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep while REM sleep was suppressed. The 
      increase in NREM sleep was accompanied by a decrease in EEG delta power during NREM 
      sleep and by a decrease in the expression of transcripts in the cerebral cortex 
      known to be associated with homeostatic sleep drive, such as Homer1a, Early growth 
      response 2, Neuronal pentraxin 2, and Fos-like antigen 2. The effect of CD40 
      activation was mimicked by peripheral TNF injection and prevented by the TNF blocker 
      etanercept. Our study indicates that sleep-wake dysregulation in autoimmune diseases 
      may result from CD40 induced TNF:TNFR1 mediated alterations of molecular pathways, 
      which regulate sleep-wake behavior.

AB  - An important function of sleep is the consolidation of memories, and features of 
      sleep, such as rapid eye movement (REM) or sleep spindles, have been shown to 
      correlate with improvements in discrete memory domains. Because of the 
      methodological difficulties in modulating sleep, however, a causal link between 
      specific sleep features and human memory consolidation is lacking. Here, we 
      experimentally manipulated specific sleep features during a daytime nap via direct 
      pharmacological intervention. Using zolpidem (Ambien), a short-acting GABAA agonist 
      hypnotic, we show increased sleep spindle density and decreased REM sleep compared 
      with placebo and sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Naps with increased spindles produced 
      significantly better verbal memory and significantly worse perceptual learning but 
      did not affect motor learning. The experimental spindles were similar to control 
      spindles in amplitude and frequency, suggesting that the experimental intervention 
      enhanced normal sleep processes. Furthermore, using statistical methods, we 
      demonstrate for the first time a critical role of spindles in human hippocampal 
      memory performance. The gains in memory consolidation exceed sleep-alone or control 
      conditions and demonstrate the potential for targeted, exceptional memory 
      enhancement in healthy adults with pharmacologically modified sleep.

PG  - 268-74
LID - 10.1097/WNP.0b013e3182933da7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The most popular metric for interrater reliability in 
      electroencephalography is the kappa (κ) score. κ calculation is laborious, requiring 
      EEG readers to read the same EEG studies. We introduce a method to determine the 
      best-case κ score (κBEST) for measuring interrater reliability between EEG readers, 
      retrospectively. METHODS: We incorporated 1 year of EEG reports read by four adult 
      EEG readers at our institution. We used SQL queries to determine EEG findings for 
      subsequent analysis. We generated logistic regression models for particular EEG 
      findings, dependent on patient age, location acuity, and EEG reader. We derived a 
      novel measure, the κBEST statistic, from the logistic regression coefficients. 
      RESULTS: Increasing patient age and location acuity were associated with decreased 
      sleep and increased diffuse abnormalities. For certain findings, EEG readers 
      exhibited the dominant influence, manifesting directly as lower between-reader κBEST 
      scores for certain EEG findings. Within-reader κBEST control scores were higher than 
      between-reader scores, suggesting internal consistency. CONCLUSIONS: The κBEST 
      metric can measure significant interrater reliability differences between any number 
      of EEG readers and reports, retrospectively, and is generalizable to other domains 
      (e.g., pathology or radiology reporting). We suggest using this metric as a guide or 
      starting point for focused quality control efforts.

AB  - Over the past several years meditation practice has gained increasing attention as a 
      non-pharmacological intervention to provide health related benefits, from promoting 
      general wellness to alleviating the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions. 
      However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully 
      characterized. Sleep provides a unique approach to explore the meditation-related 
      plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density 
      electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist 
      meditation practices (approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation 
      naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased parietal-occipital EEG gamma 
      power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25-40 Hz), 
      was not related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively 
      correlated with the length of lifetime daily meditation practice. Altogether, these 
      findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in 
      spontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep 
      represents a sensitive measure of the long-lasting, plastic effects of meditative 
      training on brain function.

AB  - BACKGROUND OBJECTIVE: measurement of plastic brain changes induced by a novel 
      rehabilitative approach is a key requirement for validating its biological rationale 
      linking the potential therapeutic gains to the changes in brain physiology. 
      OBJECTIVE: Based on an emerging notion linking cortical plastic changes to EEG sleep 
      slow-wave activity (SWA) regulation, we aimed to assess the acute plastic changes 
      induced by an imitation-based speech therapy in individuals with aphasia by 
      comparing sleep SWA changes before and after therapy. METHODS: A total of 13 
      left-hemispheric stroke patients underwent language assessment with the Western 
      Aphasia Battery (WAB) before and after 2 consecutive high-density (hd) EEG sleep 
      recordings interleaved by a daytime session of imitation-based speech therapy 
      (Intensive Mouth Imitation and Talking for Aphasia Therapeutic Effects [IMITATE]). 
      This protocol is thought to stimulate bilateral connections between the inferior 
      parietal lobule and the ventral premotor areas. RESULTS: A single exposure to 
      IMITATE resulted in increases in local EEG SWA during subsequent sleep over the same 
      regions predicted by the therapeutic rationale, particularly over the right 
      hemisphere (unaffected by the lesion). Furthermore, changes in SWA over the 
      left-precentral areas predicted changes in WAB repetition scores in our group, 
      supporting the role of perilesional areas in predicting positive functional 
      responses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SWA changes occurring in brain 
      areas activated during imitation-based aphasia therapy may reflect the acute plastic 
      changes induced by this intervention. Further testing will be needed to evaluate SWA 
      as a non-invasive assessment of changes induced by the therapy and as a predictor of 
      positive long-term clinical outcome.

TI  - Effect of prolonged wakefulness on electroencephalographic oscillatory activity 
      during sleep.
PG  - 253-60
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12123 [doi]
AB  - The human sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) is characterized by the occurrence of 
      distinct oscillatory events such as delta waves, sleep spindles and alpha activity. 
      We applied a previously proposed algorithm for the detection of such events and 
      investigated their incidence and frequency in baseline and recovery sleep after 40 h 
      of sustained wakefulness in 27 healthy young subjects. The changes in oscillatory 
      events induced by sleep deprivation were compared to the corresponding spectral 
      changes. Both approaches revealed, on average, an increase in low frequency activity 
      and a decrease in spindle activity after sleep deprivation. However, the increase of 
      oscillatory events in the delta range and decrease in the sigma range occurred in a 
      more restricted frequency range compared to spectral changes. The mean relative 
      power spectra showed a significant increase in theta and alpha activity after sleep 
      deprivation while, on average, the event analysis showed only a weak effect in the 
      theta band. The reason for this discrepancy is that the spectral analysis does not 
      distinguish between diffuse activity and clearly visible temporally localized 
      oscillations, while the event analysis would detect only the latter. Additionally, 
      only a few individuals clearly showed activity in the theta or alpha frequency 
      bands. Conversely, event analysis revealed that some individuals showed an increased 
      rate of sleep spindles after sleep deprivation, a fact that was not evident in the 
      relative power spectra due to a decrease in background activity. The two methods 
      complement each other and facilitate the interpretation of distinct changes induced 
      by prolonged wakefulness in sleep EEG.

PG  - S35-43
AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been associated with physiopathology in 
      cerebral organization and function. Electroencephalography is a noninvasive 
      technique that provides information about brain electrocortical activity. 
      Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies using power spectra have documented 
      differences associated with ASD, particularly in frontal areas that have been 
      functionally linked to cognitive functions that are disrupted in individuals with 
      ASD. Furthermore, EEG studies confirm coherence changes in individuals with ASD. 
      Many studies have also reported high rates of interictal epileptiform EEG 
      abnormalities in children with ASD with or without history of seizures. Several 
      polysomnography studies have confirmed the presence of disrupted sleep architecture 
      in children with ASD. Polysomnographic abnormalities include reduction of REM sleep, 
      longer sleep latency, increased arousals, lower sleep efficiency, increased stage 1 
      sleep and decreased slow wave sleep as well as decreased density of spindle 
      activity. The objective of this review is to present research data on the EEG 
      findings in patients with ASD, with emphasis on their power EEG, coherence EEG, 
      epileptiform EEG abnormalities and sleep disorders.

AB  - Intranasal application of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) produces a 
      well-characterized model of viral encephalitis in mice. Within one day 
      post-infection (PI), VSV travels to the olfactory bulb and, over the course of 7 
      days, it infects regions and tracts extending into the brainstem followed by 
      clearance and recovery in most mice by PI day 14 (PI 14). Infectious diseases are 
      commonly accompanied by excessive sleepiness; thus, sleep is considered a component 
      of the acute phase response to infection. In this project, we studied the 
      relationship between sleep and VSV infection using C57BL/6 (B6) and BALB/c mice. 
      Mice were implanted with transmitters for recording EEG, activity and temperature by 
      telemetry. After uninterrupted baseline recordings were collected for 2 days, each 
      animal was infected intranasally with a single low dose of VSV (5×10(4) PFU). Sleep 
      was recorded for 15 consecutive days and analyzed on PI 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. 
      Compared to baseline, amounts of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) were increased 
      in B6 mice during the dark period of PI 1-5, whereas rapid eye movement sleep (REM) 
      was significantly reduced during the light periods of PI 0-14. In contrast, BALB/c 
      mice showed significantly fewer changes in NREM and REM. These data demonstrate 
      sleep architecture is differentially altered in these mouse strains and suggests 
      that, in B6 mice, VSV can alter sleep before virus progresses into brain regions 
      that control sleep.

LID - 10.1002/hbm.22426 [doi]
AB  - Behavioral studies indicate that older adults exhibit normal motor sequence learning 
      (MSL), but paradoxically, show impaired consolidation of the new memory trace. 
      However, the neural and physiological mechanisms underlying this impairment are 
      entirely unknown. Here, we sought to identify, through functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging during MSL and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during daytime 
      sleep, the functional correlates and physiological characteristics of this 
      age-related motor memory deficit. As predicted, older subjects did not exhibit 
      sleep-dependent gains in performance (i.e., behavioral changes that reflect 
      consolidation) and had reduced sleep spindles compared with young subjects. Brain 
      imaging analyses also revealed that changes in activity across the retention 
      interval in the putamen and related brain regions were associated with sleep 
      spindles. This change in striatal activity was increased in young subjects, but 
      reduced by comparison in older subjects. These findings suggest that the deficit in 
      sleep-dependent motor memory consolidation in elderly individuals is related to a 
      reduction in sleep spindle oscillations and to an associated decrease of activity in 
      the cortico-striatal network.

TI  - Association between epileptiform discharges and the sleep cycle in 200 epileptic

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The poor sleep quality of epileptic patients may be partly due to the 
      occurrence epileptiform discharges (EDs). We observed the number of interictal 
      discharges in each sleep stage and explored the associations between EDs and sleep 
      phases in epileptic patients. METHODS: Two hundred epileptic patients and 182 
      healthy volunteers were enrolled in the current study. For all subjects, video 
      electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring and 24-hr night polysomnography were 
      conducted to detect EDs and analyze the sleep structures. RESULTS: EDs were detected 
      in 91% of epileptic patients with the most frequent cases from the temporal lobe. 
      The EDs detected during waking, sleeping, or both waking and nonrapid eye movement 
      (NREM) sleep stages 1-2 accounted for 7.1%, 19.2%, and 25.3% of the total patients, 
      respectively. EDs were rare during NREM stages 3-4 with 1.1% of total patients 
      mainly in the central-temporal lobe. The total sleep time and time spent in REM were 
      similar between the epileptic patients and healthy volunteers. However, epileptic 
      patients spent a significantly longer mean sleep time in NREM stages 1-2 (293.91 ± 
      27.57 min vs. 223.17 ±15.28; p = .000) and less in NREM stages 3-4 (50.11 ± 12.12 
      min vs. 133.96 ± 10.77; p = .000) than healthy volunteers. Furthermore, asymmetric 
      sleep spindles and fragmentary sleep structure as well as high inversion frequency 
      were found in 26.7% and 43.3% of epileptic patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Combination of long-term video EEG with polysomnography is a useful method to 
      analyze associations between EDs and the sleep-wake cycle. This strategy can also 
      help identify the nature of sleep disorders in epileptic patients, which may improve 
      the treatment efficacy.

AB  - The neurohormone melatonin activates two G-protein coupled receptors, MT1 and MT2. 
      Melatonin is implicated in circadian rhythms and sleep regulation, but the role of 
      its receptors remains to be defined. We have therefore characterized the spontaneous 
      vigilance states in wild-type (WT) mice and in three different types of transgenic 
      mice: mice with genetic inactivation of MT1 (MT1(-/-)), MT2 (MT2(-/-)) and both 
      MT1/MT2 (MT1(-/-)/MT2(-/-)) receptors. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and 
      electromyographic sleep-wake patterns were recorded across the 24-h light-dark 
      cycle. MT1(-/-)mice displayed a decrease (-37.3%) of the 24-h rapid eye movement 
      sleep (REMS) time whereas MT2(-/-)mice showed a decrease (-17.3%) of the 24-h non 
      rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) time and an increase in wakefulness time (14.8%). 
      These differences were the result of changes occurring in particular during the 
      light/inactive phase. Surprisingly, MT1(-/-)/MT2(-/-) mice showed only an increase 
      (8.9%) of the time spent awake during the 24-h. These changes were correlated to a 
      decrease of the REMS EEG theta power in MT1(-/-)mice, of the NREMS EEG delta power 
      in MT2(-/-)mice, and an increase of the REMS and wakefulness EEG theta power in 
      MT1(-/-)/MT2(-/-) mice. Our results show that the genetic inactivation of both MT1 
      and MT2 receptors produces an increase of wakefulness, likely as a result of reduced 
      NREMS due to the lack of MT2 receptors, and reduced REMS induced by the lack of MT1 
      receptors. Therefore, each melatonin receptor subtype differently regulates the 
      vigilance states: MT2 receptors mainly NREMS, whereas MT1 receptors REMS.

AB  - Monosodium glutamate, a umami taste substance is commonly used flavor enhancer. The 
      effect of intragastric administration of 1.5 ml of 0.12M monosodium glutamate on 
      sleep-wake was studied in 10 adult male Wistar rats. Sleep-wake parameters were 
      recorded through chronically implanted electroencephalogram, electrooculogram and 
      electromyogram electrodes using a digital recording system (BIOPAC system Inc. BSL 
      PRO 36, USA). The sleep-wake was recorded for 6h after the intragastric 
      administration of either glutamate or saline. Sleep-wake stages were analyzed as 
      wake, slow wave sleep and REM sleep. Compared to saline, intragastric administration 
      of glutamate significantly increased REM sleep duration and episode frequency. REM 
      sleep duration was increased in all the three 2h bins, 10:00-12:00 h (p=0.037), 
      12:00-14:00 h (p=0.037) and 14:00-16:00 h (p=0.007). The slow wave sleep and total 
      sleep time were not affected. It is concluded that intragastric glutamate 
      administration increases REM sleep.

      sleep and fewer awakenings after sleep onset.

AB  - PURPOSE: Mental toughness (MT) is understood as the display of confidence, 
      commitment, challenge, and control. Mental toughness is associated with resilience 
      against stress. However, research has not yet focused on the relation between MT and 
      objective sleep. The aim of the present study was therefore to explore the extent to 
      which greater MT is associated with objectively assessed sleep among adolescents. 
      METHODS: A total of 92 adolescents (35% females; mean age, 18.92 years) completed 
      the Mental Toughness Questionnaire. Participants were split into groups of high and 
      low mental toughness. Objective sleep was recorded via sleep electroencephalograms 
      and subjective sleep was assessed via a questionnaire. RESULTS: Compared with 
      participants with low MT, participants with high MT had higher sleep efficiency, a 
      lower number of awakenings after sleep onset, less light sleep, and more deep sleep. 
      They also reported lower daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents reporting 
      higher MT also had objectively better sleep, as recorded via sleep 
      electroencephalograms. A bidirectional association between MT and sleep seems 
      likely; therefore, among adolescence, improving sleep should increase MT, and 
      improving MT should increase sleep.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep-dependent performance improvements seem to be closely related to 
      sleep spindles (12-15 Hz) and sleep slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.75-4.5 Hz). 
      Pulse-modulated radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMF, carrier frequency 900 
      MHz) are capable to modulate these electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics of 
      sleep. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to explore possible mechanisms how RF EMF 
      affect cortical activity during sleep and to test whether such effects on cortical 
      activity during sleep interact with sleep-dependent performance changes. METHODS: 
      Sixteen male subjects underwent 2 experimental nights, one of them with all-night 
      0.25-0.8 Hz pulsed RF EMF exposure. All-night EEG was recorded. To investigate RF 
      EMF induced changes in overnight performance improvement, subjects were trained for 
      both nights on a motor task in the evening and the morning. RESULTS: We obtained 
      good sleep quality in all subjects under both conditions (mean sleep efficiency > 
      90%). After pulsed RF EMF we found increased SWA during exposure to pulse-modulated 
      RF EMF compared to sham exposure (P < 0.05) toward the end of the sleep period. 
      Spindle activity was not affected. Moreover, subjects showed an increased RF EMF 
      burst-related response in the SWA range, indicated by an increase in event-related 
      EEG spectral power and phase changes in the SWA range. Notably, during exposure, 
      sleep-dependent performance improvement in the motor sequence task was reduced 
      compared to the sham condition (-20.1%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The changes in the 
      time course of SWA during the exposure night may reflect an interaction of RF EMF 
      with the renormalization of cortical excitability during sleep, with a negative 
      impact on sleep-dependent performance improvement.

AB  - The conventional method for sleep staging is to analyze polysomnograms (PSGs) 
      recorded in a sleep lab. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most important 
      signals in PSGs but recording and analysis of this signal presents a number of 
      technical challenges, especially at home. Instead, electrocardiograms (ECGs) are 
      much easier to record and may offer an attractive alternative for home sleep 
      monitoring. The heart rate variability (HRV) signal proves suitable for automatic 
      sleep staging. Thirty PSGs from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) database were 
      used. Three feature sets were extracted from 5- and 0.5-min HRV segments: 
      time-domain features, nonlinear-dynamics features and time-frequency features. The 
      latter was achieved by using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and discrete wavelet 
      transform (DWT) methods. Normalized energies in important frequency bands of HRV 
      signals were computed using time-frequency methods. ANOVA and t-test were used for 
      statistical evaluations. Automatic sleep staging was based on HRV signal features. 
      The ANOVA followed by a post hoc Bonferroni was used for individual feature 
      assessment. Most features were beneficial for sleep staging. A t-test was used to 
      compare the means of extracted features in 5- and 0.5-min HRV segments. The results 
      showed that the extracted features means were statistically similar for a small 
      number of features. A separability measure showed that time-frequency features, 
      especially EMD features, had larger separation than others. There was not a sizable 
      difference in separability of linear features between 5- and 0.5-min HRV segments 
      but separability of nonlinear features, especially EMD features, decreased in 
      0.5-min HRV segments. HRV signal features were classified by linear discriminant 
      (LD) and quadratic discriminant (QD) methods. Classification results based on 
      features from 5-min segments surpassed those obtained from 0.5-min segments. The 
      best result was obtained from features using 5-min HRV segments classified by the LD 
      classifier. A combination of linear/nonlinear features from HRV signals is effective 
      in automatic sleep staging. Moreover, time-frequency features are more informative 
      than others. In addition, a separability measure and classification results showed 
      that HRV signal features, especially nonlinear features, extracted from 5-min 
      segments are more discriminative than those from 0.5-min segments in automatic sleep 
      staging.

AB  - The coexistence of regionally dissociated brain activity patterns -with some brain 
      areas being active while other already showing sleep signs- may occur throughout all 
      vigilance states including the transition from wakefulness to sleep and may account 
      for both physiological as well as pathological events. These dissociated 
      electrophysiological states are often characterized by multi-domain cognitive and 
      behavioral impairment such as amnesia for events immediately preceding sleep. By 
      performing simultaneous intracerebral electroencephalographic recordings from 
      hippocampal as well as from distributed neocortical sites in neurosurgical patients, 
      we observed that sleep spindles consistently occurred in the hippocampus several 
      minutes before sleep onset. In addition, hippocampal spindle detections consistently 
      preceded neocortical events, with increasing delays along the cortical 
      antero-posterior axis. Our results support the notion that wakefulness and sleep are 
      not mutually exclusive states, but rather part of a continuum resulting from the 
      complex interaction between diffuse neuromodulatory systems and intrinsic properties 
      of the different thalamocortical modules. This interaction may account for the 
      occurrence of dissociated activity across different brain structures characterizing 
      both physiological and pathological conditions.

AB  - Recently, many lines of investigation in neuroscience and statistical physics have 
      converged to raise the hypothesis that the underlying pattern of neuronal activation 
      which results in electroencephalography (EEG) signals is nonlinear, with self-affine 
      dynamics, while scalp-recorded EEG signals themselves are nonstationary. Therefore, 
      traditional methods of EEG analysis may miss many properties inherent in such 
      signals. Similarly, fractal analysis of EEG signals has shown scaling behaviors that 
      may not be consistent with pure monofractal processes. In this study, we 
      hypothesized that scalp-recorded human EEG signals may be better modeled as an 
      underlying multifractal process. We utilized the Physionet online database, a 
      publicly available database of human EEG signals as a standardized reference 
      database for this study. Herein, we report the use of multifractal detrended 
      fluctuation analysis on human EEG signals derived from waking and different sleep 
      stages, and show evidence that supports the use of multifractal methods. Next, we 
      compare multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to a previously published 
      multifractal technique, wavelet transform modulus maxima, using EEG signals from 
      waking and sleep, and demonstrate that multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis 
      has lower indices of variability. Finally, we report a preliminary investigation 
      into the use of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis as a pattern 
      classification technique on human EEG signals from waking and different sleep 
      stages, and demonstrate its potential utility for automatic classification of 
      different states of consciousness. Therefore, multifractal detrended fluctuation 
      analysis may be a useful pattern classification technique to distinguish among 
      different states of brain function.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are commonly associated with menopause. Hormone replacement 
      therapy is often used to treat various menopausal symptoms, but its efficacy for 
      improving sleep is a matter of debate. We addressed this question by using a rodent 
      model of ovarian hormone loss and replacement in midlife. Middle-aged female rats 
      were ovariectomized and implanted with capsules containing estradiol with or without 
      progesterone, or oil. After two weeks, sleep/wake states were recorded 
      polygraphically during a 24-h baseline period, followed by 6h of sleep deprivation 
      in the second half of the light phase, and a 24-h recovery period. During the 
      baseline dark phase, hormone treatments increased wakefulness, and decreased 
      non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) by shortening NREMS episodes; however, NREMS 
      EEG delta power or energy (cumulative power) was unaffected by combined hormones. 
      Following sleep deprivation, all the groups showed NREMS and rapid eye movement 
      sleep (REMS) rebounds, with similar relative increases from respective baseline 
      levels. The increases in NREMS EEG delta power/energy during recovery were enhanced 
      by combined hormones. These results from middle-aged ovariectomized rats indicate 
      that replacement with estrogen with or without progesterone reduces baseline NREMS 
      without affecting sleep intensity, particularly during the dark (active) phase, 
      whereas following sleep deprivation the same hormone treatments do not affect the 
      ability to increase NREMS or REMS, but treatment with both hormones, in particular, 
      enhances the intensity of recovery sleep. These results support the usefulness of 
      ovariectomized middle-aged rats as a model system to study the biological effects of 
      hormone replacement on sleep regulation.

AB  - The relationship between learning and sleep is multifaceted; learning influences 
      subsequent sleep characteristics, which may in turn influence subsequent memory. 
      Studies in humans indicate that sleep may not only prevent degradation of acquired 
      memories, but even enhance performance without further practice. In a rodent 
      instrumental learning task, individual differences occur in how fast rats learn to 
      associate lever pressing with food reward. Rats habitually sleep between learning 
      sessions, and may differ in this respect. The current study assessed if the 
      instrumental leaning paradigm could serve as a model to study sleep-dependent memory 
      enhancement. Male Wistar rats performed 2 sessions of instrumental learning per day 
      for 1-3 days. Electroencephalography was recorded both before and after the 
      sessions. Sleep deprivation (3 h) was applied between the first and second session 
      in a subgroup of rats. Measurements comprised the number of lever presses in each 
      session, slow wave sleep (SWS) duration, Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REMS) duration 
      and sleep spindles. Baseline sleep parameters were similar for fast and slow 
      learning rats. Task-exposure increased REMS-duration. The increase in REMS-duration 
      was observed specifically after sessions in which learning occurred, but not after a 
      later session. Sleep deprivation during the 3h period between the initial two 
      sessions interfered with performance enhancement, but did not prevent this in all 
      rats. Our considered movement control protocol induced partial sleep deprivation and 
      also interfered with performance enhancement. The classic instrumental learning task 
      provides a practical model for animal studies on sleep-dependent memory enhancement.

AB  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is modulated by sleep and wakefulness. 
      Noninvasive assessment of cardiac ANS with heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is 
      a window for monitoring malfunctioning of cardiovascular autonomic modulation due to 
      sleep deprivation. This study represents the first investigation of dynamic ANS 
      effects and of electrophysiological and subjective sleepiness, in parallel, during 
      40 h of prolonged wakefulness under constant routine (CR) conditions. In eleven 
      young male healthy subjects, ECG, EEG, EOG, and EMG chin recordings were performed 
      during baseline sleep, during 40 h of sleep deprivation, and during recovery sleep. 
      After sleep deprivation, slow-wave sleep and sleep efficiency increased, whereas HRV 
      - global variability and HRV sympathovagal balance - was reduced (all p<0.05). 
      Sleep-stage-dependent analysis revealed reductions in the sympathovagal balance only 
      for NREM sleep stages (all p<0.05). Comparison of the daytime pattern of CR day one 
      (CR baseline) with that of CR day two (CR sleep deprivation) disclosed an increase 
      in subjective sleepiness, in the amount of unintended sleep, and in HRV 
      sympathovagal balance, with accompaniment by increased EEG alpha attenuation (all 
      p<0.05). Circadian rhythm analysis revealed the strongest influence on heart rate, 
      with less influence on HRV sympathovagal balance. Hour-by-hour analysis disclosed 
      the difference between CR sleep deprivation and CR baseline for subjective 
      sleepiness at almost every single hour and for unintended sleep particularly in the 
      morning and afternoon (both p<0.05). These findings indicate that 40 h of prolonged 
      wakefulness lead in the following night to sleep-stage-dependent reduction in 
      cardiac autonomic modulation. During daytime, an increased occurrence of behavioral 
      and physiological signs of sleepiness was accompanied by diminished cardiac 
      autonomic modulation. The observed changes are an indicator of autonomic stress due 
      to sleep deprivation - which, if chronic, could potentially increase cardiovascular 
      risk.

AB  - Spindles - a hallmark of stage II sleep - are a transient oscillatory phenomenon in 
      the EEG believed to reflect thalamocortical activity contributing to 
      unresponsiveness during sleep. Currently spindles are often classified into two 
      classes: fast spindles, with a frequency of around 14 Hz, occurring in the 
      centro-parietal region; and slow spindles, with a frequency of around 12 Hz, 
      prevalent in the frontal region. Here we aim to establish whether the spindle 
      generation process also exhibits spatial heterogeneity. Electroencephalographic 
      recordings from 20 subjects were automatically scanned to detect spindles and the 
      time occurrences of spindles were used for statistical analysis. Gamma distribution 
      parameters were fit to each inter-spindle interval distribution, and a modified 
      Wald-Wolfowitz lag-1 correlation test was applied. Results indicate that not all 
      spindles are generated by the same statistical process, but this dissociation is not 
      spindle-type specific. Although this dissociation is not topographically specific, a 
      single generator for all spindle types appears unlikely.

TI  - Vascular compliance limits during sleep deprivation and recovery sleep.
PG  - 1459-70
LID - 10.5665/sleep.3036 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Our previous studies showed that evoked hemodynamic responses are 
      smaller during wake compared to sleep; suggesting neural activity is associated with 
      vascular expansion and decreased compliance. We explored whether prolonged activity 
      during sleep deprivation may exacerbate vascular expansion and blunt hemodynamic 
      responses. DESIGN: Evoked auditory responses were generated with periodic 65 dB 
      speaker clicks over a 72-h period and measured with cortical electrodes. Evoked 
      hemodynamic responses were measured simultaneously with optical techniques using 
      three light-emitting diodes, and a photodiode. SETTING: Animals were housed in 
      separate 30×30×80 cm enclosures, tethered to a commutator system and maintained on a 
      12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. PATIENTS OR 
      PARTICIPANTS: Seven adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Following a 
      24-h baseline recording, sleep deprivation was initiated for 0 to 10 h by gentle 
      handling, followed by a 24-h recovery sleep recording. Evoked electrical and 
      hemodynamic responses were measured before, during, and after sleep deprivation. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Following deprivation, evoked hemodynamic amplitudes were 
      blunted. Steady-state oxyhemoglobin concentration increased during deprivation and 
      remained high during the initial recovery period before returning to baseline levels 
      after approximately 9-h. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep deprivation resulted in blood vessel 
      expansion and decreased compliance while lower basal neural activity during recovery 
      sleep may allow blood vessel compliance to recover. Chronic sleep restriction or 
      sleep deprivation could push the vasculature to critical levels, limiting blood 
      delivery, and leading to metabolic deficits with the potential for neural trauma.

AB  - The important EEG changes that occur throughout childhood are a major challenge for 
      the neurophysiologist. These reflect brain maturation, which is especially fast 
      during the first year of life. This article describes normal EEG features and 
      variants, characteristic patterns of development, as well as some patterns that are 
      unusual for age, from the neonatal period to adolescence. We also describe how to 
      adapt techniques and prepare patients in order to get interpretable records of 
      appropriate duration, in neonates, infants, and young children.

AB  - Both scientists and the general public assume that physical activity (PA) is an 
      effective, non-pharmacological approach to improvement in sleep quality. However, 
      objective and reliable data on this relationship are scarce, particularly for 
      adolescents. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to test the relationship 
      by assessing both PA and sleep subjectively and objectively. A total of 56 
      adolescent vocational school students (Mean age=17.98, SD=1.36; 28 males, 28 
      females) participated in the study. Sleep and PA were subjectively assessed via 
      questionnaires. Accelerometers objectively assessed PA, while sleep-EEG devices 
      objectively assessed sleep. The data supported our prediction that adolescents with 
      high PA levels would have longer TST, fewer wakening at night (WASO), fewer symptoms 
      of insomnia, and higher sleep quality. However, gender influenced this pattern of 
      results in that significant findings were only found between high self-reported PA 
      levels and shorter perceived sleep onset latency (SOL). Though self-reported PA 
      levels were a better predictor of good sleep than objectively assessed PA levels, 
      gender was associated with sleep complaints; females reported more sleep complaints. 
      Results indicate that among a non-clinical sample of adolescents increased PA is 
      favorably associated with restoring sleep. Therefore, PA seems beneficial not only 
      for physical and mental health, but also for sleep restoration.

TI  - Periodic leg movements are associated with reduced sleep quality in older men: the 
      MrOS Sleep Study.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) are common in the elderly. 
      A previous large polysomnographic (PSG) study examining the relationship of PLMS to 
      sleep architecture and arousals from sleep in women found that leg movements were 
      common in elderly women, and PLMS which were associated with EEG arousals had a 
      strong and consistent association with markers of disturbed sleep. Since sleep 
      differs in men and women, we now investigate the association between PLMS and PSG 
      indices of sleep quality in a large community-based sample of older men. DESIGN: 
      Observational study, cross-sectional analyses. SETTING: Six clinical sites 
      participating in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study. PARTICIPANTS: 2,872 
      older community-dwelling men (mean age 76.4 years) who completed in-home PSG from 
      2003-2005. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In-home PSG was performed 
      which included bilateral measurement of leg movements. The total number of leg 
      movements per hour of sleep (PLMI) and the number of leg movements causing 
      EEG-documented arousals per hour of sleep (PLMA) were computed. A PLMI ≥ 5 (70.8%) 
      and PLMA ≥ 5 (27.4%) were both prevalent. Linear regression models were used to 
      examine the relationship between PLMS as predictors and sleep architecture, arousal 
      index, and sleep efficiency as outcomes. The highest quintiles of PLMI (≥ 65.1) and 
      PLMA (≥ 6.8) showed the largest association with indices of sleep architecture; PLMA 
      showed a larger magnitude of effect. After multivariate adjustment, participants 
      with a higher PLMA had a small but significantly higher arousal index, lower sleep 
      efficiency, higher percentages of stages 1 and 2 sleep, and lower percentages of 
      stage 3-4 and REM sleep (p < 0.01). An increased PLMI was similarly associated with 
      a higher arousal index, higher percentage of stage 2 sleep, and lower percentage of 
      stage 3-4 (p < 0.0001), but not with an increase in stage 1, REM sleep, or sleep 
      efficiency. Neither PLMI nor PMLA was associated with subjective sleepiness measured 
      by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that periodic 
      leg movements are very common in older community-dwelling men and regardless of 
      associated arousals, are associated with evidence of lighter and more fragmented 
      sleep.

AB  - In this study, we investigated subjective and objective effects of mobile phones 
      using a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA)-like system on human sleep. 
      Subjects were 19 volunteers. Real or sham electromagnetic field (EMF) exposures for 
      3 h were performed before their usual sleep time on 3 consecutive days. They were 
      exposed to real EMF on the second or third experimental day in a double-blind 
      design. Sleepiness and sleep insufficiency were evaluated the next morning. 
      Polysomnograms were recorded for analyses of the sleep variables and power spectra 
      of electroencephalograms (EEG). No significant differences were observed between the 
      two conditions in subjective feelings. Sleep parameters including sleep stage 
      percentages and EEG power spectra did not differ significantly between real and sham 
      exposures. We conclude that continuous wave EMF exposure for 3 h from a W-CDMA-like 
      system has no detectable effects on human sleep.

TI  - Lithium prevents REM sleep deprivation-induced impairments on memory consolidation.
PG  - 1677-84
LID - 10.5665/sleep.3126 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-training rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) deprivation affects memory 
      acquisition and/or consolidation. It also produces major REMS rebound at the cost of 
      waking and slow wave sleep (SWS). Given that both SWS and REMS appear to be 
      important for memory processes, REMS rebound after training may disrupt the 
      organization of sleep cycles, i.e., excessive amount of REMS and/or little SWS after 
      training could be harmful for memory formation. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether 
      lithium, a drug known to increase SWS and reduce REMS, could prevent the memory 
      impairment induced by pre-training sleep deprivation. DESIGN: Animals were divided 
      in 2 groups: cage control (CC) and REMS-deprived (REMSDep), and then subdivided into 
      4 subgroups, treated either with vehicle or 1 of 3 doses of lithium (50, 100, and 
      150 mg/kg) 2 h before training on the multiple trial inhibitory avoidance task. 
      Animals were tested 48 h later to make sure that the drug had been already 
      metabolized and eliminated. Another set of animals was implanted with electrodes and 
      submitted to the same experimental protocol for assessment of drug-induced 
      sleep-wake changes. SUBJECTS: Wistar male rats weighing 300-400 g. RESULTS: Sleep 
      deprived rats required more trials to learn the task and still showed a performance 
      deficit during test, except from those treated with 150 mg/kg of lithium, which also 
      reduced the time spent in REM sleep during sleep recovery. CONCLUSION: Lithium 
      reduced rapid eye movement sleep and prevented memory impairment induced by sleep 
      deprivation. These results indicate that these phenomena may be related, but 
      cause-effect relationship cannot be ascertained.

TI  - Neuroligin-1 links neuronal activity to sleep-wake regulation.
PG  - 9974-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1221381110 [doi]
AB  - Maintaining wakefulness is associated with a progressive increase in the need for 
      sleep. This phenomenon has been linked to changes in synaptic function. The synaptic 
      adhesion molecule Neuroligin-1 (NLG1) controls the activity and synaptic 
      localization of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, which activity is impaired by 
      prolonged wakefulness. We here highlight that this pathway may underlie both the 
      adverse effects of sleep loss on cognition and the subsequent changes in cortical 
      synchrony. We found that the expression of specific Nlg1 transcript variants is 
      changed by sleep deprivation in three mouse strains. These observations were 
      associated with strain-specific changes in synaptic NLG1 protein content. 
      Importantly, we showed that Nlg1 knockout mice are not able to sustain wakefulness 
      and spend more time in nonrapid eye movement sleep than wild-type mice. These 
      changes occurred with modifications in waking quality as exemplified by low 
      theta/alpha activity during wakefulness and poor preference for social novelty, as 
      well as altered delta synchrony during sleep. Finally, we identified a 
      transcriptional pathway that could underlie the sleep/wake-dependent changes in Nlg1 
      expression and that involves clock transcription factors. We thus suggest that NLG1 
      is an element that contributes to the coupling of neuronal activity to sleep/wake 
      regulation.

TI  - Females with sleep bruxism show lower theta and alpha electroencephalographic 
      activity irrespective of transient morning masticatory muscle pain.
PG  - 123-34
LID - 10.11607/jop.999 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the hypothesis that the presence of transient morning 
      masticatory muscle pain in young, healthy sleep bruxers (SBr) is associated with 
      sex-related differences in sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. METHODS: 
      Data on morning masticatory muscle pain and sleep variables were obtained from 
      visual analog scales and a second night of polysomnographic recordings. Nineteen 
      normal control (CTRL) subjects were age- and sex-matched to 62 tooth-grinding SBr. 
      Differences in sleep macrostructure (stage distribution and duration, number of 
      sleep-stage shifts), number of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) events÷ 
      hour, and EEG activity were analyzed blind to subject status. The influence of pain 
      and gender in SBr and CTRL subjects was assessed with the Fisher's exact test, 
      Mann-Whitney U test, two-sample t test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: 
      Low-intensity morning transient orofacial pain was reported by 71% of SBr, with no 
      sex difference. RMMA event frequency was higher in SB than CTRL subjects (4.5÷hour 
      vs 1.3÷hour; P < .001). SBr had fewer sleep-stage shifts, irrespective of sex or 
      pain status. Female SBr had significantly lower theta and alpha EEG activity 
      compared to female CTRL subjects (P = .03), irrespective of pain. CONCLUSION: Female 
      SBr had lower theta and alpha EEG activity irrespective of transient morning pain.

AB  - The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) represents a major aggregation of 
      cholinergic neurons in the mammalian brainstem, which is important in the generation 
      and maintenance of REM sleep. We investigated the effects of unilateral and 
      bilateral PPT lesions on sleep and all the conventional sleep-state related EEG 
      frequency bands amplitudes, in an attempt to find the EEG markers for the onset and 
      progression of PPT cholinergic neuronal degeneration. The experiments were performed 
      on 35 adult male Wistar rats, chronically implanted for sleep recording. During the 
      surgical procedure for EEG and EMG electrodes implantation, the unilateral or 
      bilateral PPT lesion was produced under ketamine/diazepam anesthesia, by the 
      stereotaxically guided microinfusion of 100 nl 0.1M ibotenic acid (IBO) into PPT. We 
      applied Fourier analysis to signals acquired throughout 6h of recordings, and each 
      10s epoch was differentiated as a Wake, NREM or REM state. We also calculated the 
      group probability density estimates (PDE) of all Wake, NREM and REM conventional EEG 
      frequency amplitudes, and the number of all the transition states using MATLAB 6.5. 
      Our results show that the unilateral or bilateral PPT lesions did not change the 
      sleep/wake architecture, but did change the sleep/wake state transitions structure 
      and the sleep/state related "EEG microstructure". Unilateral or bilateral PPT 
      lesions sustainably increased Wake/REM and REM/Wake transitions from 14 to 35 days 
      after lesions. This was followed by decreased NREM/REM and REM/NREM transitions from 
      28 days only in the case of the bilateral PPT lesion. The unilateral PPT lesion 
      augmented both Wake theta and REM beta while it also attenuated the relative 
      amplitude of the Wake delta frequency, with a delay of one week. Following a 
      bilateral PPT lesion there was augmentation of the relative amplitude of the Wake, 
      NREM, and REM beta and REM gamma frequency which occurred simultaneously to NREM and 
      Wake delta attenuation. We have shown that the PPT cholinergic neuronal loss 
      sustainably increased the number of the Wake/REM and REM/Wake transitions and 
      augmented sleep-states related cortical activation that was simultaneously expressed 
      by the high frequency amplitude augmentation, as well as Wake and NREM delta 
      frequency attenuation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Electroencephalography (EEG) assessment in research and clinical studies 
      is limited by the patient burden of multiple electrodes and the time needed to 
      manually score records. The objective of our study was to investigate the accuracy 
      of an automated sleep-staging algorithm which is based on a single bipolar EEG 
      signal. METHODS: Three raters each manually scored the polysomnographic (PSG) 
      records from 44 patients referred for sleep evaluation. Twenty-one PSG records were 
      scored by Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) criteria (group 1) and 23 PSGs were scored 
      by American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 2007 criteria (group 2). Majority 
      agreement was present in 98.4% of epochs and was used for comparison to automated 
      scoring from a single EEG lead derived from the left and right electrooculogram. 
      RESULTS: The κ coefficients for interrater manual scoring ranged from 0.46 to 0.89. 
      The κ coefficient for the auto algorithm vs manual scoring by rater ranged from 0.42 
      to 0.63 and was 0.61 (group 1, κ=0.61 and group 2, κ=0.62) for majority agreement 
      for all studies. The mean positive percent agreement across subjects and stages was 
      72.6%, approximately 80% for stages wake (78.3%), stage 2 sleep (N2) (80.9%), and 
      stage 3 sleep (N3) (78.1%); the percentage slightly decreased to 73.2% for rapid eye 
      movement (REM) sleep and dropped to 31.9% for stage 1 sleep (N1). Differences in 
      agreement were observed based on raters, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity, 
      medications, and signal quality. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that automated 
      scoring of sleep obtained from a single-channel of forehead EEG results in agreement 
      to majority manual scoring are similar to results obtained from studies of manual 
      interrater agreement. The benefit in assessing auto-staging accuracy with consensus 
      agreement across multiple raters is most apparent in patients with OSA; 
      additionally, assessing auto-staging accuracy limited disagreements in patients on 
      medications and in those with compromised signal quality.

TI  - Analyzing EEG signals under insulin-induced hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes 
      patients.
PG  - 1980-3
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609917 [doi]
AB  - Hypoglycemia is dangerous and considered as a limiting factor of the glycemic 
      control therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Nocturnal 
      hypoglycemia is especially feared because early warning symptoms are unclear during 
      sleep so an episode of hypoglycemia may lead to a fatal effect on patients. The main 
      objective of this paper is to explore the correlation between hypoglycemia and 
      electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To do this, the EEG of five T1DM adolescents 
      from an overnight insulin-induced study is analyzed by spectral analysis to extract 
      four different parameters. We aim to explore the response of these parameters during 
      the clamp study which includes three main phases of normal, hypoglycemia and 
      recovery. We also look at data at the blood glucose level (BGL) of 3.3-3.9 mmol/l to 
      find a threshold to distinguish between non-hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia states. 
      The results show that extracted EEG parameters are highly correlated with patients' 
      conditions during the study. It is also shown that at the BGL of 3.3 mmol/l, 
      responses to hypoglycemia in EEG signals start to significantly occur.

TI  - Estradiol modulates recovery of REM sleep in a time-of-day-dependent manner.
PG  - R271-80
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00474.2012 [doi]
AB  - Ovarian hormones are thought to modulate sleep and fluctuations in the hormonal 
      milieu are coincident with sleep complaints in women. In female rats, estradiol 
      increases waking and suppresses sleep. In this study, we asked whether this effect 
      is mediated via circadian or homeostatic regulatory mechanisms. Ovariectomized 
      female rats received daily injections of estradiol benzoate (EB) or sesame oil that 
      mimicked the rapid increase and subsequent decline of circulating estradiol at 
      proestrus. In one experiment, animals were sleep deprived for 6 h starting at 
      lights-on, so that recovery began in the mid-light phase; in the second experiment, 
      animals were sleep deprived starting in the mid-light phase, so that recovery began 
      at lights-off. EB suppressed baseline rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) 
      sleep and increased waking in the dark phase. In both experiments, EB enhanced REM 
      recovery in the light phase while suppressing it in the dark compared with oil; this 
      effect was most pronounced in the first 6 h of recovery. By contrast, NREM recovery 
      was largely unaffected by EB. In summary, EB enhanced waking and suppressed sleep, 
      particularly REM sleep, in the dark under baseline and recovery conditions. These 
      strong temporally dependent effects suggest that EB consolidates circadian 
      sleep-wake rhythms in female rats.

PG  - 10182-90
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0284-13.2013 [doi]
AB  - Memories are consolidated during sleep by two apparently antagonistic processes: (1) 
      reinforcement of memory-specific cortical interactions and (2) homeostatic reduction 
      in synaptic efficiency. Using fMRI, we assessed whether episodic memories are 
      processed during sleep by either or both mechanisms, by comparing recollection 
      before and after sleep. We probed whether LTP influences these processes by 
      contrasting two groups of individuals prospectively recruited based on BDNF rs6265 
      (Val66Met) polymorphism. Between immediate retrieval and delayed testing scheduled 
      after sleep, responses to recollection increased significantly more in Val/Val 
      individuals than in Met carriers in parietal and occipital areas not previously 
      engaged in retrieval, consistent with "systems-level consolidation." Responses also 
      increased differentially between allelic groups in regions already activated before 
      sleep but only in proportion to slow oscillation power, in keeping with "synaptic 
      downscaling." Episodic memories seem processed at both synaptic and systemic levels 
      during sleep by mechanisms involving LTP.

      Reaction time (RT) distributions were analyzed and the sensitivity of the error 
      negativity (Ne/Ne like) to response correctness was examined. Results showed that 
      (1) the Simon effect persisted for the longest RTs only after sleep deprivation and 
      (2) the sensitivity of the Ne/Ne like to correctness decreased after sleep 
      deprivation, especially on incongruent trials. This suggests that after sleep 
      deprivation (1) the ability to inhibit prepotent response tendencies is impaired and 
      (2) the sensitivity of a response monitoring system as revealed by the error 
      negativity is less sensitive to performance. In conclusion, action monitoring was 
      affected by sleep deprivation as revealed by distributional analyses and the 
      sensitivity of the Ne/Ne like to performance, which may be attributed to the 
      fragility of prefrontal structures to sleep deprivation.

TI  - Sleep deprivation before stroke is neuroprotective: a pre-ischemic conditioning

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We have previously shown in a rat model of focal cerebral 
      ischemia that sleep deprivation after stroke onset aggravates brain damage. Others 
      reported that sleep deprivation prior to stroke is neuroprotective. The main aim of 
      this study was to test the hypothesis that the neuroprotection may be related to an 
      increase in sleep (sleep rebound) during the acute phase of stroke. METHODS: Male 
      Sprague Dawley rats (n=36) were subjected to continuous polygraphic recordings for 
      baseline, total sleep deprivation (TSD), and 24h after ischemia. TSD for 6h was 
      performed by gentle handling and immediately followed by ischemia. Focal cerebral 
      ischemia was induced by permanent occlusion of distal branches of the middle 
      cerebral artery. Control experiments included ischemia without SD (nSD) and sham 
      surgery with TSD (n=6/group). RESULTS: Shortly after stroke, the amount of slow wave 
      sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) increased significantly (p<0.05) in the 
      TSD/ischemia, resulting in an increase in the total sleep time by 30% compared to 
      baseline, or by 20% compared with the nSD/ischemia group. The infarct volume 
      decreased significantly by 50% in the TSD/ischemia compared to nSD group (p<0.02). 
      Removal of sleep rebound by allowing TSD-rats sleep for 24h before ischemia 
      eliminated the reduction in the infarct size. CONCLUSION PRESTROKE: Sleep 
      deprivation results in sleep rebound and reduces brain damage. Sleep rebound may be 
      causally related to the neuroprotection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep slow wave activity (SWA; EEG power 
      between 0.6 and 4Hz) has been proposed as a marker of central synaptic plasticity. 
      Decreased generation of sleep slow waves--a core feature of sleep in 
      depression--indicates underlying plasticity changes in the disease. Various measures 
      of SWA have previously been used to predict antidepressant treatment response. This 
      study examined the relationship between baseline patterns of SWA in the first two 
      NREM episodes and antidepressant response to an acute infusion of the 
      N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine. METHODS: Thirty patients (20M, 10F, 
      18-65) fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder 
      (MDD) who had been drug-free for two weeks received a single open-label infusion of 
      ketamine hydrochloride (.5mg/kg) over 40 min. Depressive symptoms were assessed with 
      the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after ketamine 
      infusion. Sleep recordings were obtained the night before the infusion and were 
      visually scored. SWA was computed for individual artifact-free NREM sleep epochs, 
      and averaged for each NREM episode. Delta sleep ratio (DSR) was calculated as 
      SWA(NREM1)/SWA(NREM2). RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was observed 
      between baseline DSR and reduced MADRS scores from baseline to Day 1 (r=.414, 
      p=.02). LIMITATIONS: The sample size was relatively small (N=30) and all subjects 
      had treatment-resistant MDD, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. 
      Further studies are needed to replicate and extend this observation to other patient 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: DSR may be a useful baseline predictor of ketamine response in 
      individuals with treatment-resistant MDD.

      International Pharmaco-EEG Society (IPEG).
PG  - 127-67
LID - 10.1159/000343449 [doi]
AB  - The International Pharmaco-EEG Society (IPEG) presents guidelines summarising the 
      requirements for the recording and computerised evaluation of pharmaco-sleep data in 
      man. Over the past years, technical and data-processing methods have advanced 
      steadily, thus enhancing data quality and expanding the palette of sleep assessment 
      tools that can be used to investigate the activity of drugs on the central nervous 
      system (CNS), determine the time course of effects and pharmacodynamic properties of 
      novel therapeutics, hence enabling the study of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      relationship, and evaluate the CNS penetration or toxicity of compounds. However, 
      despite the presence of robust guidelines on the scoring of polysomnography 
      -recordings, a review of the literature reveals inconsistent -aspects in the 
      operating procedures from one study to another. While this fact does not invalidate 
      results, the lack of standardisation constitutes a regrettable shortcoming, 
      especially in the context of drug development programmes. The present guidelines are 
      intended to assist investigators, who are using pharmaco-sleep measures in clinical 
      research, in an effort to provide clear and concise recommendations and thereby to 
      standardise methodology and facilitate comparability of data across laboratories.

TI  - Neonatal thalamic hemorrhage is strongly associated with electrical status 
      epilepticus in slow wave sleep.
PG  - 733-40
LID - 10.1111/epi.12131 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Thalamic hemorrhage has been associated with neonatal cerebral sinovenous 
      thrombosis (CSVT), especially when the straight sinus is involved, and often 
      presents with neonatal seizures. Early thalamic injury has previously been shown to 
      predispose to epilepsy and electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES). 
      The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of sleep-induced epileptic 
      electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities and postneonatal epilepsy after neonatal 
      thalamic hemorrhage associated with CSVT, in the absence of more widespread cerebral 
      damage. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2008 15 neonates were diagnosed with a thalamic 
      hemorrhage due to suspected or proven CSVT. Neurodevelopment and the history of 
      seizures were assessed at follow-up in the outpatient clinic in all 14 survivors 
      (age 2-9 years). Whole-night or sleep-deprived EEG recordings were obtained to 
      assess the prevalence of interictal epileptiform activity (EA) and calculate a 
      sleep-induced spike and wave index (SWI). KEY FINDINGS: Three children were 
      diagnosed with classic ESES (SWI >85%). Two children had ESES spectrum disorder (SWI 
      between 50% and 85%), and in two children significant sleep-induced epileptiform 
      activity (SIEA) was noted (SWI between 25% and 50%). Two other children were 
      diagnosed with focal epilepsy, in the absence of sleep-induced epileptiform EEG 
      abnormalities. Five children (age 2-7 years) had normal EEG recordings at follow-up. 
      Deficits in neurodevelopment were seen significantly more often in children with 
      ESES, ESES spectrum, or SIEA. SIGNIFICANCE: Neonates with thalamic hemorrhage 
      associated with straight sinus thrombosis, without evidence of more widespread 
      cerebral damage, are at high risk of developing ESES (spectrum) disorder (35%), SIEA 
      (14%), or focal epilepsy (14%). Electrographic abnormalities may already be present 
      prior to recognition of cognitive deficits. Early diagnosis may guide parents and 
      caregivers, and subsequent treatment may improve neurodevelopmental outcome. Routine 
      annual sleep EEG recordings in children with neonatal thalamic injury following CSVT 
      may improve recognition of ESES.

AB  - One of the most significant problems facing older individuals is difficulty staying 
      asleep at night and awake during the day. Understanding the mechanisms by which the 
      regulation of sleep/wake goes awry with age is a critical step in identifying novel 
      therapeutic strategies to improve quality of life for the elderly. We measured wake, 
      non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in young (2-4 
      months-old) and aged (22-24 months-old) C57BL6/NIA mice. We used both conventional 
      measures (i.e., bout number and bout duration) and an innovative spike-and-slab 
      statistical approach to characterize age-related fragmentation of sleep/wake. The 
      short (spike) and long (slab) components of the spike-and-slab mixture model capture 
      the distribution of bouts for each behavioral state in mice. Using this novel 
      analytical approach, we found that aged animals are less able to sustain long 
      episodes of wakefulness or NREM sleep. Additionally, spectral analysis of EEG 
      recordings revealed that aging slows theta peak frequency, a correlate of arousal. 
      These combined analyses provide a window into the mechanisms underlying the 
      destabilization of long periods of sleep and wake and reduced vigilance that develop 
      with aging.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep spindles have been suggested as surrogates of thalamo-cortical 
      activity. Internal frequency modulation within a spindle's time frame has been 
      demonstrated in healthy subjects, showing that spindles tend to decelerate their 
      frequency before termination. We investigated internal frequency modulation of slow 
      and fast spindles according to Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity and brain 
      topography. METHODS: Seven non-OSA subjects and 21 patients with OSA contributed 
      with 30min of Non-REM sleep stage 2, subjected to a Matching pursuit procedure with 
      Gabor chirplet functions for automatic detection of sleep spindles and 
      quantification of sleep spindle internal frequency modulation (chirp rate). RESULTS: 
      Moderate OSA patients showed an inferior percentage of slow spindles with 
      deceleration when compared to Mild and Non-OSA groups in frontal and parietal 
      regions. In parietal regions, the percentage of slow spindles with deceleration was 
      negatively correlated with global apnea-hypopnea index (rs=-0.519, p=0.005). 
      DISCUSSION: Loss of physiological sleep spindle deceleration may either represent a 
      disruption of thalamo-cortical loops generating spindle oscillations or some 
      compensatory mechanism, an interesting venue for future research in the context of 
      cognitive dysfunction in OSA. SIGNIFICANCE: Quantification of internal frequency 
      modulation (chirp rate) is proposed as a promising approach to advance description 
      of sleep spindle dynamics in brain pathology.

TI  - Morphine inhibits sleep-promoting neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area via mu 
      receptors and induces wakefulness in rats.
PG  - 791-801

AB  - Morphine is the most efficacious and widely prescribed treatment for pain. However, 
      it decreases the total amount of deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep in humans. 
      Acute morphine administration at low doses causes wakefulness in animal models. To 
      clarify the mechanism by which morphine affects sleep-wake behavior, we investigated 
      the effects of morphine on the sleep-promoting neurons of the ventrolateral preoptic 
      area (VLPO), a putative sleep-active nucleus, using in vitro brain slices by the 
      patch-clamp technique. We also examined the effects of morphine on sleep-wake 
      profiles after administration of opioid receptor antagonist to the VLPO using EEG 
      and electromyogram recordings in freely moving rats. The results showed that 
      morphine inhibited the firing rate of sleep-promoting neurons and hyperpolarized 
      their membrane potentials without affecting interneurons in the VLPO. 
      Morphine-induced hyperpolarization of membrane potentials could be reversed by, 
      D-Phe-Cys-Thr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTOP), a mu receptor antagonist, in the 
      presence of tetrodotoxin. However, after the mu receptors were blocked by CTOP, 
      morphine still suppressed the firing of the sleep-promoting neurons. This effect was 
      antagonized by nor-BIN, a kappa receptor antagonist. Activation of kappa receptor by 
      U50488H inhibited the firing of the sleep-promoting neurons. These results indicate 
      that morphine could inhibit the activity of sleep-promoting neurons in the VLPO 
      through mu and kappa receptors. EEG recordings revealed that morphine injected 
      subcutaneously induced arousal in a dose-dependent manner. CTOP microinjected into 
      VLPO antagonized the arousal effects of morphine, but nor-BIN did not. However, CTOP 
      alone was not associated with any changes in the physiological sleep-wake cycle. 
      Taken together, these findings clearly indicate that morphine inhibits 
      sleep-promoting neurons in the VLPO by affecting mu receptors and so induces 
      wakefulness in rats.

AB  - Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) are uncontrollable nocturnal movements that 
      occur during sleep and increase with age. Research has implicated PLMS as a 
      contributing factor to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose 
      of this manuscript is to 1) explain the sleep disorder of PLMS and implications on 
      CVD; 2) identify the impact of PLMS on CVD; 3) discuss treatment options for PLMS; 
      4) present future research needs for PLMS/RLS; 5) provide implications to health 
      care providers to improve the care and health outcomes of persons with PLMS.

TI  - Symmetrical serotonin release during asymmetrical slow-wave sleep: implications for 
      the neurochemistry of sleep-waking states.
PG  - 2555-61
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2603-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - On land, fur seals predominately display bilaterally synchronized 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during slow-wave sleep (SWS), similar to that 
      observed in all terrestrial mammals. In water, however, fur seals exhibit asymmetric 
      slow-wave sleep (ASWS), resembling the unihemispheric slow-wave sleep of odontocetes 
      (toothed whales). The unique sleeping pattern of fur seals allows us to distinguish 
      neuronal mechanisms mediating EEG changes from those mediating behavioral 
      quiescence. In a prior study we found that cortical acetylcholine release is 
      lateralized during ASWS in the northern fur seal, with greater release in the 
      hemisphere displaying low-voltage (waking) EEG activity, linking acetylcholine 
      release to hemispheric EEG activation (Lapierre et al. 2007). In contrast to 
      acetylcholine, we now report that cortical serotonin release is not lateralized 
      during ASWS. Our data demonstrate that bilaterally symmetric levels of serotonin are 
      compatible with interhemispheric EEG asymmetry in the fur seal. We also find greatly 
      elevated levels during eating and hosing the animals with water, suggesting that 
      serotonin is more closely linked to bilateral variables, such as axial motor and 
      autonomic control, than to the lateralized cortical activation manifested in 
      asymmetrical sleep.

AB  - This study characterizes the spatial-temporal distribution of epileptic activity in 
      mesial and neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) assessed by subdural and depth 
      electrodes during sleep. We determined in 13 patients the frequency, lateralization, 
      and localization of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). As compared to the 
      waking state, IEDs increased in light sleep (196%, p < 0.05) and in deep sleep 
      (601%, p < 0.05) but did not change significantly in REM sleep (-8.33%, p = 0.94). 
      From 11 patients with unilateral TLE, in all cases, IEDs lateralized to the seizure 
      onset side during REM sleep and the waking state. In mesial TLE, IEDs tended to 
      shift in an anterior-posterior axis and remained always localized in the 
      amygdalo-hippocampal complex. By contrast, in neocortical TLE, the maximal activity 
      moved in a mesial-lateral axis between neocortical and mesial structures. Twenty-six 
      seizures were registered in 7 patients, 22 of which occurred in light sleep and 4 in 
      wakefulness, but none occurred in deep or REM sleep.

      unprocessed electroencephalogram (EEG) samples are scarce. We evaluated the accuracy 
      of a tailored automated spike quantification algorithm. The automated quantification 
      was compared with the quantification by two board-certified clinical 
      neurophysiologists (gold-standard) in five steps: 1) accuracy in a single EEG 
      channel (5 EEG samples), 2) accuracy in multiple EEG channels and across different 
      stages of the sleep-wake cycles (75 EEG samples), 3) capacity to detect 
      lateralization of spikes (6 EEG samples), 4) accuracy after application of a 
      machine-learning mechanism (11 EEG samples), and 5) accuracy during wakefulness only 
      (8 EEG samples). Our method was accurate during all stages of the sleep-wake cycle 
      and improved after the application of the machine-learning mechanism. Spikes were 
      correctly lateralized in all cases. Our automated method was accurate in quantifying 
      and detecting the lateralization of interictal spikes in raw unprocessed EEG 
      samples.

AB  - We aimed at better understanding the brain mechanisms involved in the processing of 
      alerting meaningful sounds during sleep, investigating alpha activity. During EEG 
      acquisition, subjects were presented with a passive auditory oddball paradigm 
      including rare complex sounds called Novels (the own first name - OWN, and an 
      unfamiliar first name - OTHER) while they were watching a silent movie in the 
      evening or sleeping at night. During the experimental night, the subjects' quality 
      of sleep was generally preserved. During wakefulness, the decrease in alpha power 
      (8-12 Hz) induced by Novels was significantly larger for OWN than for OTHER at 
      parietal electrodes, between 600 and 900 ms after stimulus onset. Conversely, during 
      REM sleep, Novels induced an increase in alpha power (from 0 to 1200 ms at all 
      electrodes), significantly larger for OWN than for OTHER at several parietal 
      electrodes between 700 and 1200 ms after stimulus onset. These results show that 
      complex sounds have a different effect on the alpha power during wakefulness 
      (decrease) and during REM sleep (increase) and that OWN induce a specific effect in 
      these two states. The increased alpha power induced by Novels during REM sleep may 
      1) correspond to a short and transient increase in arousal; in this case, our study 
      provides an objective measure of the greater arousing power of OWN over OTHER, 2) 
      indicate a cortical inhibition associated with sleep protection. These results 
      suggest that alpha modulation could participate in the selection of stimuli to be 
      further processed during sleep.

TI  - Effects of stressor predictability on escape learning and sleep in mice.
PG  - 421-30
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2464 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Controllable stress, modeled by escapable shock (ES), can produce 
      significant alterations in post-stress sleep, including increased rapid eye movement 
      (REM) sleep. Recent work has demonstrated that post-stress sleep may be influenced 
      by stressor predictability, modeled by predictive auditory cues. In this study, we 
      trained mice with ES, either signaled (SES) or unsignaled (UES) by auditory cues, 
      and investigated the effects of predictability on escape learning and sleep 
      associated with ES. DESIGN: Adult male BALB/cJ mice were implanted for recording 
      electroencephalography and activity via telemetry. After the mice recovered from 
      surgery, baseline sleep recordings were obtained. The mice were then randomly 
      assigned to SES and UES conditions. Both groups had control over the duration of 
      footshocks (0.5 mA; 5.0 sec maximum duration) by moving to the non-occupied chamber 
      in a shuttlebox. SES mice were presented tones (90 dB, 2 kHz, 10 sec maximum 
      duration) that started 5.0 sec prior to and co-terminated with footshocks. UES mice 
      were presented identical tones that were not synchronized to shock presentation. ES 
      training continued for 2 consecutive days (EST1 and EST2) with 20 footshock 
      presentations (1 min inter-stimulus intervals). Seven days after EST2, the animals 
      were re-exposed to the training chamber (context) alone for 30 min. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      RESULTS: Escape latency was used to determine successful or unsuccessful escape 
      learning. Sleep was scored for 20 h for baseline and on each treatment day. Freezing 
      in the training context was scored as a behavioral index of fear. Nine of 14 SES 
      mice successfully learned escape (SESl), and 5 failed to learn escape (SESf). 
      Compared with baseline, SESl mice, but not SESf mice, showed significantly increased 
      post-shock REM. All UES mice learned escape and showed enhanced post-shock REM. 
      Freezing and sleep did not differ among groups on the context re-exposure day. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that information available in a stressful 
      situation can affect an animal's ability to learn an appropriate response and 
      post-stress sleep. CITATION: Machida M; Yang L; Wellman LL; Sanford LD. Effects of

AB  - In recent years, the amount of children with sleep disorders that cause arousal 
      during sleep or light sleep is increasing. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD) is a cause of this sleep disorder; children with ADHD have frequent body 
      movement during sleep. Therefore, we investigated the body movement during sleep of 
      children with and without ADHD using video imaging. We analysed large gross body 
      movements (GM) that occur and obtained the GM rate and the rest duration. There were 
      differences between the body movements of children with ADHD and normally developed 
      children. The children with ADHD moved frequently, so their rest duration was 
      shorter than that of the normally developed children. Additionally, the rate of 
      gross body movement indicated a significant difference in REM sleep (p < 0.05). In 
      the future, we will develop a new device that can easily diagnose children with 
      ADHD, using video image processing.

TI  - Dim light at night does not disrupt timing or quality of sleep in mice.
PG  - 1016-23

AB  - Artificial nighttime illumination has recently become commonplace throughout the 
      world; however, in common with other animals, humans have not evolved in the 
      ecological context of chronic light at night. With prevailing evidence linking the 
      circadian, endocrine, immune, and metabolic systems, understanding these 
      relationships is important to understanding the etiology and progression of several 
      diseases. To eliminate the covariate of sleep disruption in light at night studies, 
      researchers often use nocturnal animals. However, the assumption that light at night 
      does not affect sleep in nocturnal animals remains unspecified. To test the effects 
      of light at night on sleep, we maintained Swiss-Webster mice in standard light/dark 
      (LD) or dim light at night (DLAN) conditions for 8-10 wks and then measured 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) biopotentials via wireless 
      telemetry over the course of two consecutive days to determine differences in sleep 
      timing and homeostasis. Results show no statistical differences in total percent 
      time, number of episodes, maximum or average episode durations in wake, slow-wave 
      sleep (SWS), or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. No differences were evident in SWS 
      delta power, an index of sleep drive, between groups. Mice kept in DLAN conditions 
      showed a relative increase in REM sleep during the first few hours after the 
      dark/light transition. Both groups displayed normal 24-h circadian rhythms as 
      measured by voluntary running wheel activity. Groups did not differ in body mass, 
      but a marked negative correlation of body mass with percent time spent awake and a 
      positive correlation of body mass with time spent in SWS was evident. Elevated body 
      mass was also associated with shorter maximum wake episode durations, indicating 
      heavier animals had more trouble remaining in the wake vigilance state for extended 
      periods of time. Body mass did not correlate with activity levels, nor did activity 
      levels correlate with time spent in different sleep states. These data indicate that 
      heavier animals tend to sleep more, potentially contributing to further weight gain. 
      We conclude that chronic DLAN exposure does not significantly affect sleep timing or 
      homeostasis in mice, supporting the use of dim light with nocturnal rodents in 
      chronobiology research to eliminate the possible covariate of sleep disruption.

TI  - The glycolytic metabolite methylglyoxal induces changes in vigilance by generating 
      low-amplitude non-REM sleep.
PG  - 1070-5
LID - 10.1177/0269881113495596 [doi]
AB  - Methylglyoxal (MG), an essential by-product of glycolysis, is a highly reactive 
      endogenous α-oxoaldehyde. Although high levels of MG are cytotoxic, physiological 
      doses of MG were shown to reduce anxiety-related behavior through selective 
      activation of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors. Because the latter play 
      a major role in sleep induction, this study examined the potential of MG to regulate 
      sleep. Specifically, we assessed how MG influences sleep-wake behavior in CD1 mice 
      that received intracerebroventricular injections of either vehicle or 0.7 µmol MG at 
      onset of darkness. We used electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) 
      recordings to monitor changes in vigilance states, sleep architecture and the EEG 
      spectrum, for 24 h after receipt of injections. Administration of MG rapidly induced 
      non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and, concomitantly, decreased wakefulness and 
      suppressed EEG delta power during NREMS. In addition, MG robustly enhanced the 
      amount and number of episodes of an unclassified state of vigilance in which EMG, as 
      well as EEG delta and theta power, were very low. MG did not affect overall rapid 
      eye movement sleep (REMS) in a given 24-h period, but significantly reduced the 
      power of theta activity during REMS. Our results provide the first evidence that MG 
      can exert sleep-promoting properties by triggering low-amplitude NREMS.

AB  - Emotional memories are vividly remembered for the long-term. Rapid eye movement 
      (REM) sleep has been repeatedly proposed to support the superior retention of 
      emotional memories. However, its exact contribution and, specifically, whether its 
      effect is mainly on the consolidation of the contents or the processing of the 
      affective component of emotional memories is not clear. Here, we investigated the 
      effects of sleep rich in slow wave sleep (SWS) or REM sleep on the consolidation of 
      emotional pictures and the accompanying changes in affective tone, using 
      event-related potentials (ERPs) together with subjective ratings of valence and 
      arousal. Sixteen healthy, young men learned 50 negative and 50 neutral pictures 
      before 3-h retention sleep intervals that were filled with either SWS-rich early or 
      REM sleep-rich late nocturnal sleep. In accordance with our hypothesis, recognition 
      was better for emotional pictures than neutral pictures after REM compared to 
      SWS-rich sleep. This emotional enhancement after REM-rich sleep expressed itself in 
      an increased late positive potential of the ERP over the frontal cortex 300-500 ms 
      after stimulus onset for correctly classified old emotional pictures compared with 
      new emotional and neutral pictures. Valence and arousal ratings of emotional 
      pictures were not differentially affected by REM or SWS-rich sleep after learning. 
      Our results corroborate that REM sleep contributes to the consolidation of emotional 
      contents in memory, but suggest that the affective tone is preserved rather than 
      reduced by the processing of emotional memories during REM sleep.

AB  - When dealing with electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded under resting conditions, 
      periods of low-voltage activity might indicate drowsiness, but mental activation as 
      well. Thus, low-voltage EEG retrieves a notorious source of confusion. The 
      simultaneous occurrence of drowsiness related slow horizontal eye movements (SEM) 
      allow to assign low-voltage EEG-activity to a brain state of reduced vigilance 
      instead of mental activation. The aim of this study was to investigate, whether 
      under resting conditions with eyes closed low-voltage EEG with SEM (B1+) and without 
      SEM (B1-) differ in spectral and spatial distribution of EEG-activity. EEGs of 35 
      healthy subjects where analyzed, each containing at least 10 s of low-voltage EEG 
      recorded during a calculation task (calc, as control condition), as well as 10 s of 
      each B1- and B1+, recorded during following about 20 min of rest. Using 
      standardized, low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, cortical current 
      density was computed in four individually adapted frequency bands (delta, theta, 
      alpha, beta) for calc, B1- and B1+. Paired test comparison of cortical current 
      densities revealed significant differences for B1- compared to B1+. In detail, B1- 
      exhibited lower delta- and theta band activity, especially in the cingulate- and 
      adjacent medial portions of the frontal, parietal and occipital cortices, as well as 
      higher beta band activity in temporal cortices. Similar results where found in calc 
      versus B1+. These findings support the association of B1- to a higher level of 
      vigilance compared to B1+, thus justifying the separation of low-voltage 
      EEG-activity by means of SEM.

PG  - 1330-9
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12143 [doi]
AB  - During cognitive processes there are extensive interactions between various regions 
      of the cerebral cortex. Oscillations in the gamma frequency band (≈40 Hz) of the 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) are involved in the binding of spatially separated but 
      temporally correlated neural events, which results in a unified perceptual 
      experience. The extent of these interactions can be examined by means of a 
      mathematical algorithm called 'coherence', which reflects the 'strength' of 
      functional interactions between cortical areas. The present study was conducted to 
      analyse EEG coherence in the gamma frequency band of the cat during alert 
      wakefulness (AW), quiet wakefulness (QW), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and 
      rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Cats were implanted with electrodes in the frontal, 
      parietal and occipital cortices to monitor EEG activity. Coherence values within the 
      gamma frequency (30-100 Hz) from pairs of EEG recordings were analysed. A large 
      increase in coherence occurred between all cortical regions in the 30-45 Hz 
      frequency band during AW compared with the other behavioral states. As the animal 
      transitioned from AW to QW and from QW to NREM sleep, coherence decreased to a 
      moderate level. Remarkably, there was practically no EEG coherence in the entire 
      gamma band spectrum (30-100 Hz) during REM sleep. We conclude that functional 
      interactions between cortical areas are radically different during sleep compared 
      with wakefulness. The virtual absence of gamma frequency coherence during REM sleep 
      may underlie the unique cognitive processing that occurs during dreams, which is 
      principally a REM sleep-related phenomenon.

TI  - Differential adaptation of REM sleep latency, intermediate stage and theta power 
      effects of escitalopram after chronic treatment.
PG  - 169-76
LID - 10.1007/s00702-012-0847-2 [doi]
AB  - The effects of the widely used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
      antidepressants on sleep have been intensively investigated. However, only a few 
      animal studies examined the effect of escitalopram, the more potent S-enantiomer of 
      citalopram, and conclusions of these studies on sleep architecture are limited due 
      to the experimental design. Here, we investigate the acute (2 and 10 mg/kg, i.p. 
      injected at the beginning of the passive phase) or chronic (10 mg/kg/day for 21 
      days, by osmotic minipumps) effects of escitalopram on the sleep and quantitative 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) of Wistar rats. The first 3 h of EEG recording was 
      analyzed at the beginning of passive phase, immediately after injections. The 
      acutely injected 2 and 10 mg/kg and the chronically administered 10 mg/kg/day 
      escitalopram caused an approximately three, six and twofold increases in rapid eye 
      movement sleep (REMS) latency, respectively. Acute 2-mg/kg escitalopram reduced 
      REMS, but increased intermediate stage of sleep (IS) while the 10 mg/kg reduced 
      both. We also observed some increase in light slow wave sleep and passive wake 
      parallel with a decrease in deep slow wave sleep and theta power in both active wake 
      and REMS after acute dosing. Following chronic treatment, only the increase in REMS 
      latency remained significant compared to control animals. In conclusion, adaptive 
      changes in the effects of escitalopram, which occur after 3 weeks of treatment, 
      suggest desensitization in the function of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptors.

AB  - The relationships between biological rhythms and human aggressive behavior are 
      addressed and discussed in this article: First, circadian rhythms and aggression are 
      considered. Studies of sleep/waking cycle disturbances in aggression are reported. 
      Severe aggression is associated with profound changes in sleep architecture. Causal 
      link is difficult to establish given that sleep disturbance and aggressive behavior 
      could be the symptoms of the same disorder. Specific aggressive behavior developed 
      during sleep is also described. In addition, hormonal circadian rhythm studies are 
      reported. Thus, low cortisol levels, in particular low cortisol variability, are 
      associated with aggressive behavior, suggesting an inhibitory role of cortisol. 
      Testosterone has daily and seasonal fluctuations, but no link with aggression has 
      been established. Neurophysiological underlying mechanisms are discussed in the last 
      part of this article, with a focus on the relationship between brain rhythm and 
      aggression. Increase of slow-wave EEG activities is observed in individuals with 
      aggressive behavior. Epilepsy, as a disease of brain rhythm could be associated with 
      aggressive behavior, in pre, post and inter ictal periodes. Incidence of aggression 
      is not likely more prevalent in epileptic individuals compared to those with other 
      neurological conditions. Ictal changes take the form of profound behavioral changes, 
      including aggressive behavior which has been interpreted as the emergence of 
      "archeical" or innate motor patterns. In this multidisciplinary approach, the main 
      difficulty is the categorization of the differents types of aggression. Finally, 
      taken together, these studies suggest that biological rhythms, especially circadian 
      rhythms, could provide therapeutic benefits to human aggressive behavior. Biological 
      rhythymicity seems to be a necessary permanent training offering interesting 
      perspectives for the adaptation to changes in the field of aggression.

TI  - Brief light stimulation during the mouse nocturnal activity phase simultaneously 
      induces a decline in core temperature and locomotor activity followed by 
      EEG-determined sleep.
PG  - R459-71
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00460.2012 [doi]
AB  - Light exerts a variety of effects on mammals. Unexpectedly, one of these effects is 
      the cessation of nocturnal locomotion and the induction of behavioral sleep 
      (photosomnolence). Here, we extend the initial observations in several ways, 
      including the fundamental demonstration that core body temperature (T(c)) drops 
      substantially (about 1.5°C) in response to the light stimulation at CT15 or CT18 in 
      a manner suggesting that the change is a direct response to light rather than simply 
      a result of the locomotor suppression. The results show that 1) the decline of 
      locomotion and T(c) begin soon after nocturnal light stimulation; 2) the variability 
      in the magnitude and onset of light-induced locomotor suppression is very large, 
      whereas the variability in T(c) is very small; 3) T(c) recovers from the 
      light-induced decline in advance of the recovery of locomotion; 4) under entrained 
      and freerunning conditions, the daily late afternoon T(c) increase occurs in advance 
      of the corresponding increase in wheel running; and 5) toward the end of the 
      subjective night, the nocturnally elevated T(c) persists longer than does locomotor 
      activity. Finally, EEG measurements confirm light-induced sleep and, when T(c) or 
      locomotion was measured, show their temporal association with sleep onset. Both EEG- 
      and immobility-based sleep detection methods confirm rapid induction of 
      light-induced sleep. The similarities between light-induced loss of locomotion and 
      drop in T(c) suggest a common cause for parallel responses. The photosomnolence 
      response may be contingent upon both the absence of locomotion and a simultaneous 
      low T(c).

      response.
PG  - 724-31

AB  - Activation of the immune system elicits several behavioral changes collectively 
      called sickness. Among the behavioral changes, systemic infections induce an 
      increase in time spent in nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and an increase of slow 
      wave activity (or "sleep pressure"). Using an inducible, astrocyte-specific 
      transgenic dominant negative SNARE (dnSNARE) mouse line we recently demonstrated 
      that gliotransmission plays an important role in sleep homeostasis through an 
      adenosine receptor 1 (A1R)-sensitive pathway. It has been hypothesized that systemic 
      infection, mimicked by peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 
      increases sleeping behavior in part through upregulation of central adenosine 
      levels. Moreover, as a source of immunologically relevant factors, astrocytes play a 
      pivotal role in the central nervous system immune and inflammatory responses. 
      However, little is known about the role of astrocytes in the CNS response to a 
      peripheral immune challenge. We hypothesize that LPS impacts sleep homeostasis 
      through the modulation of astrocyte-derived adenosine accumulation. We therefore 
      used dnSNARE mice to determine whether astrocytes contribute to the increased sleep 
      pressure under immune challenge and whether this is a result of changes in adenosine 
      signaling. We demonstrate that dnSNARE-mediated gliotransmission is required for the 
      ability of LPS to elevate sleep pressure as measured by the power of slow wave 
      activity during NREM sleep. Moreover, in agreement with a role of astrocyte-derived 
      adenosine in modulating sleep homeostasis, we find that intracerebroventricular 
      infusion of the A1R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT) mimics this 
      dnSNARE phenotype. Taken together, our data demonstrate that astrocytic adenosine 
      acting through A1 receptors contributes to the modulation of sleep pressure by LPS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although neuronal activity drives all aspects of cortical development, 
      how human brain rhythms spontaneously mature remains an active area of research. We 
      sought to systematically evaluate the emergence of human brain rhythms and 
      functional cortical networks over early development. METHODS: We examined cortical 
      rhythms and coupling patterns from birth through adolescence in a large cohort of 
      healthy children (n=384) using scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) in the sleep state. 
      RESULTS: We found that the emergence of brain rhythms follows a stereotyped sequence 
      over early development. In general, higher frequencies increase in prominence with 
      striking regional specificity throughout development. The coordination of these 
      rhythmic activities across brain regions follows a general pattern of maturation in 
      which broadly distributed networks of low-frequency oscillations increase in density 
      while networks of high frequency oscillations become sparser and more highly 
      clustered. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a predictable program directs the 
      development of key rhythmic components and physiological brain networks over early 
      development. SIGNIFICANCE: This work expands our knowledge of normal cortical 
      development. The stereotyped neurophysiological processes observed at the level of 
      rhythms and networks may provide a scaffolding to support critical periods of 
      cognitive growth. Furthermore, these conserved patterns could provide a sensitive 
      biomarker for cortical health across development.

TI  - Slow wave sleep induced by GABA agonist tiagabine fails to benefit memory 
      consolidation.
PG  - 1317-26
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2954 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Slow wave sleep (SWS) plays a pivotal role in consolidating 
      memories. Tiagabine has been shown to increase SWS in favor of REM sleep without 
      impacting subjective sleep. However, it is unknown whether this effect is paralleled 
      by an improved sleep-dependent consolidation of memory. DESIGN: This double-blind 
      within-subject crossover study tested sensitivity of overnight retention of 
      declarative neutral and emotional materials (word pairs, pictures) as well as a 
      procedural memory task (sequence finger tapping) to oral administration of placebo 
      or 10 mg tiagabine (at 22:30). PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen healthy young men aged 21.9 
      years (range 18-28 years). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Tiagabine significantly 
      increased the time spent in SWS and decreased REM sleep compared to placebo. 
      Tiagabine also enhanced slow wave activity (0.5-4.0 Hz) and density of < 1 Hz slow 
      oscillations during NREM sleep. Fast (12-15 Hz) and slow (9-12 Hz) spindle activity, 
      in particular that occurring phase-locked to the slow oscillation cycle, was 
      decreased following tiagabine. Despite signs of deeper and more SWS, overnight 
      retention of memory tested after sleep the next evening (19:30) was generally not 
      improved after tiagabine, but on average even lower than after placebo, with this 
      impairing effect reaching significance for procedural sequence finger tapping. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that increasing slow wave sleep with tiagabine does not 
      improve memory consolidation. Possibly this is due to functional differences from 
      normal slow wave sleep, i.e., the concurrent suppressive influence of tiagabine on 
      phase-locked spindle activity.

TI  - Identification of the mechanism mediating genioglossus muscle suppression in REM 
      sleep.
PG  - 311-9
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201209-1654OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Inhibition of pharyngeal motoneurons accompanies REM sleep and is a cause 
      of hypoventilation and obstructive sleep apnea in humans. One explanation posits 
      that the neurotransmitters glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid are responsible for REM 
      sleep motor inhibition. However, blockade of that mechanism at cranial motor nuclei 
      increases motor activity in all sleep-wake states, and least of all in REM sleep, 
      arguing against it as a major mechanism of REM sleep pharyngeal motor inhibition. 
      OBJECTIVES: To identify the mechanism of REM sleep inhibition at the hypoglossal 
      motor pool. METHODS: Genioglossus and diaphragm activities were recorded in 34 rats 
      across sleep-wake states. Microdialysis probes were implanted into the hypoglossal 
      motor pool. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Here we show that muscarinic receptor 
      antagonism at the hypoglossal motor pool prevents the inhibition of genioglossus 
      activity throughout REM sleep; likewise, with G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying 
      potassium (GIRK) channel blockade. Importantly, the genioglossus activating effects 
      of these interventions were largest in REM sleep and minimal or often absent in 
      other sleep-wake states. Finally, we showed that muscarinic inhibition of the 
      genioglossus is functionally linked to GIRK channel activation. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      identify a powerful cholinergic-GIRK channel mechanism operating at the hypoglossal 
      motor pool that has its largest inhibitory influence in REM sleep and minimal or no 
      effects in other sleep-wake states. This mechanism is the major cause of REM sleep 
      inhibition at a pharyngeal motor pool critical for effective breathing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to compare the sleep macroarchitecture 
      of children and adolescents whose mothers have a history of depression with children 
      and adolescents whose mothers do not. METHOD: Polysomnography (PSG) and Holter 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) were used to compare the sleep architecture of 35 
      children whose mothers had at least one previous depressive episode (19 boys, aged 
      4-18 years, "high-risk" group) and 25 controls (13 males, aged 4-18 years, 
      "low-risk" group) whose mothers had never had a depressive episode. The total sleep 
      time, wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), sleep latency, sleep efficiency, number 
      of awakenings per hour of sleep, percentages of time spent in each sleep stage, 
      rapid eye movement (REM) latency and the depressive symptoms of participants were 
      measured. RESULTS: In children (4-12 years old), the high-risk group exhibited 
      significantly more depressive symptoms than controls (P=0.02). However, PSG 
      parameters were not significantly different between high-risk children and controls. 
      In adolescents (13-18 years old), the high-risk subjects presented with 
      significantly more depressive symptoms (P=0.003), a significant increase in WASO 
      (P=0.019) and a significant decrease in sleep efficiency compared to controls 
      (P=0.009). CONCLUSION: This study shows that children and adolescents born from 
      mothers with a history of at least one depressive episode had significantly more 
      depressive symptoms than controls. However, only high-risk adolescents presented 
      with concurrent alterations of sleep macroarchitecture.

      were retested and scanned 12 h later after a night of sleep during which 
      polysomnographic measures were recorded. An automatic algorithm was used to detect 
      sleep spindles and to quantify their characteristics (i.e., density, amplitude, and 
      duration). Analyses revealed significant positive correlations between gains in 
      performance and the amplitude of spindles. Moreover, significant increases in BOLD 
      signal were observed in several motor-related areas, most of which were localized in 
      the right hemisphere, particularly in the right cortico-striatal system. Such 
      increases in BOLD signal also correlated positively with the amplitude of spindles 
      at several derivations. Taken together, our results show that sleep spindles predict 
      neural and behavioral changes in overnight motor sequence consolidation.

AB  - Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS) 
      is a spectrum of epileptic conditions best defined by the association of cognitive 
      or behavioral impairment acquired during childhood and not related to another factor 
      other than the presence of abundant interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) during 
      sleep, which tend to diffuse over the whole scalp. It is part of the childhood focal 
      epileptic syndromes, some cases being idiopathic and overlapping with benign 
      rolandic epilepsy, and others being symptomatic of a structural brain lesion. 
      Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is a particular presentation where acquired aphasia 
      is the core symptom. Clinical, neurophysiological, and cerebral glucose metabolism 
      data support the hypothesis that IED play a prominent role in the cognitive deficits 
      by interfering with the neuronal networks at the site of the epileptic foci but also 
      at distant connected areas. Therefore, the treatment should aim to suppress IED. 
      This may be achieved using conventional antiepileptic drugs, but corticosteroids 
      seem to have more pronounced and sustained efficacy. Outcome for epilepsy is usually 
      good, CSWS being an age-dependent EEG pattern, whereas outcome for cognition, 
      language, and behavior is variable. Rehabilitation represents an important part of 
      the treatment and visual forms of language should be encouraged in children with 
      LKS.

TI  - Acute exposure to evening blue-enriched light impacts on human sleep.
PG  - 573-80

AB  - Light in the short wavelength range (blue light: 446-483 nm) elicits direct effects 
      on human melatonin secretion, alertness and cognitive performance via 
      non-image-forming photoreceptors. However, the impact of blue-enriched polychromatic 
      light on human sleep architecture and sleep electroencephalographic activity remains 
      fairly unknown. In this study we investigated sleep structure and sleep 
      electroencephalographic characteristics of 30 healthy young participants (16 men, 14 
      women; age range 20-31 years) following 2 h of evening light exposure to 
      polychromatic light at 6500 K, 2500 K and 3000 K. Sleep structure across the first 
      three non-rapid eye movement non-rapid eye movement - rapid eye movement sleep 
      cycles did not differ significantly with respect to the light conditions. All-night 
      non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalographic power density indicated that 
      exposure to light at 6500 K resulted in a tendency for less frontal non-rapid eye 
      movement electroencephalographic power density, compared to light at 2500 K and 
      3000 K. The dynamics of non-rapid eye movement electroencephalographic slow wave 
      activity (2.0-4.0 Hz), a functional index of homeostatic sleep pressure, were such 
      that slow wave activity was reduced significantly during the first sleep cycle after 
      light at 6500 K compared to light at 2500 K and 3000 K, particularly in the frontal 
      derivation. Our data suggest that exposure to blue-enriched polychromatic light at 
      relatively low room light levels impacts upon homeostatic sleep regulation, as 
      indexed by reduction in frontal slow wave activity during the first non-rapid eye 
      movement episode.

TI  - Long-term CPAP treatment partially improves the link between cardiac vagal influence 
      and delta sleep.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/1471-2466-13-29 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment improves the risk 
      of cardiovascular events in patients suffering from severe sleep apnea-hypopnea 
      syndrome (SAHS) but its effect on the link between delta power band that is related 
      to deep sleep and the relative cardiac vagal component of heart rate variability, 
      HF(nu) of HRV, is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CPAP restores 
      the link between cardiac autonomic activity and delta sleep across the night. 
      METHODS: Eight patients suffering from severe SAHS before and after 4 ± 3 years of 
      nasal CPAP treatment were matched with fourteen healthy controls. Sleep EEG and ECG 
      were analysed to obtain spectral sleep and HRV components. Coherence analysis was 
      applied between HF(nu) and delta power bands across the first three sleep cycles. 
      RESULTS: Sleep characteristics and spectral HRV components were similar between 
      untreated patients, treated patients and controls, with the exception of decreased 
      Rapid Eye Movement duration in untreated patients. Coherence and gain values between 
      HF(nu) and delta EEG variability were decreased in untreated patients while gain 
      values normalized in treated patients. In patients before and during long-term CPAP 
      treatment, phase shift and delay between modifications in HF(nu) and delta EEG 
      variability did not differ from controls but were not different from zero. In 
      healthy men, changes in cardiac vagal activity appeared 9 ± 7 minutes before 
      modifications in delta sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term nasal CPAP restored, in severe 
      SAHS, the information between cardiovascular and sleep brainstem structures by 
      increasing gain, but did not improve its tightness or time shift.

TI  - [The role of sleep in ADHD: possibilities for prevention of ADHD?].
PG  - 773-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Personalized medicine aims to provide the right treatment for the right 
      person at the right time, as opposed to the currently employed ‘one-size-fits-all ' 
      approach. This development relies on identification of ADHD subgroups using 
      biomarkers. One important ADHD subgroup is characterised by impaired vigilance 
      regulation, as quantified by the EEG and this sub-group responds well to stimulant 
      medication and neurofeedback. Recent insights suggest a clear association between 
      reduced sleep duration and ADHD complaints in this sub-group of ADHD patients. A 
      recently published model explains how different treatments e.g. chronobiological 
      treatments and neurofeedback impact on this neural circuitry and mediate ADHD 
      symptom improvement. AIM: To test this recently published model predicting a 
      relationship between solar intensity and ADHD prevalence. METHOD: A literature 
      survey on studies using identical methods to estimate the prevalence of ADHD in 
      different geographical areas and compare those to worldwide solar intensity data. 
      RESULTS: A clear relationship between solar intensity and the worldwide prevalence 
      of ADHD was found, explaining 34-57% of the variance in ADHD prevalence, where a 
      lower prevalence of ADHD was found in areas with high solar-intensity. CONCLUSION: 
      The preventative effect of high solar intensity may be related to improvement of 
      circadian clock disturbances. These findings likely apply to a substantial sub-group 
      of ADHD patients and have major implications for our understanding of the etiology 
      and possibly prevention of ADHD.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of zonisamide (ZNS) 
      as adjunctive therapy on sleep-wake cycle and daytime somnolence in adult patients 
      affected by focal epilepsy. METHODS: Thirteen patients affected by focal epilepsy 
      were recruited to undergo a 24-hour ambulatory polysomnography, Multiple Sleep 
      Latency Test (MSLT), and a subjective evaluation of nocturnal sleep by means of the 
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and daytime somnolence by means of the Epworth 
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS) before and after 3 months of treatment with ZNS as add-on 
      therapy. RESULTS: Twelve patients completed the study. Zonisamide therapy reduced 
      seizures by >50% in 8 out of 12 patients. Zonisamide did not induce any significant 
      changes in nocturnal polysomnographic variables and in PSQI scores. In addition, 
      mean sleep latency and ESS score were unmodified after treatment. CONCLUSION: 
      Zonisamide seems to be effective and safe in focal epilepsy. Both subjective and 
      objective sleep parameters showed no detrimental effects on nocturnal sleep and 
      daytime somnolence in patients with focal epilepsy using ZNS. Since some AEDs induce 
      sleep impairment, which is known to trigger EEG abnormalities and seizures and to 
      worsen quality of life, our findings suggest a positive profile of ZNS.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Radix of Stephania tetrandrae S. Moore has been used 
      since antiquity in China as an antirheumatic, antihypertension, analgesic and 
      antipyretic agent. Tetrandrine is the major component of Stephania tetrandrae. This 
      study aims to evaluate the antihypertensive and hypnotic effect of tetrandrine on 
      spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and the possible mechanisms. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) were recorded in 
      freely moving rats and the sleep parameters were analyzed with SleepSign software. 
      The levels of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and their 
      metabolites were examined to investigate the underlying mechanisms by using 
      HPLC-ECD. Blood pressure was measured by noninvasive blood pressure tail cuff test. 
      RESULTS: Tetrandrine (100mg/kg, i.g.) significantly suppressed blood pressure of SHR 
      rats day by day during three days treatment. Meanwhile, tetrandrine remarkably 
      improved the sleep efficiency by increasing total sleep time, rapid eye movement 
      (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep (including deep sleep and light sleep) time 
      from the first day. Three days treatment of tetrandrine induced 5-HT concentration 
      decrease in DRN, 5-HIAA concentration increase in LC and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio increase 
      in VTA and LC. In contrast, no changes in NE and DA concentrations in the DRN, VTA 
      and LC occurred in SHR after tetrandrine treatment. These results indicate that 
      modulation of 5-HT, its metabolite 5-HIAA and the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in DRN, VTA and 
      LC are likely the mechanism of antihypertensive and hypnotic effects of tetrandrine 
      at least in part. CONCLUSION: This is the first observation that tetrandrine 
      possesses both anti-hypertension and hypnotic effects in SHR and suggested that 
      tetrandrine may be useful for the treatment of hypertension patients who accompanied 
      with short sleep time and poor sleep efficiency.

AB  - Human sleep depth was traditionally assessed by scoring electro-encephalographic 
      slow-wave amplitudes at the globally standardized C4-M1 electrode derivation. Since 
      2007, the American Association of Sleep Medicine (AASM) has accepted three 
      additional derivations for the same purpose. These might well differ in slow wave 
      amplitudes which would bias the scorings. Some derivations might also introduce 
      large inter-individual variability. We compared mean and variability of slow wave 
      amplitudes between six derivations including the four AASM ones. Slow wave 
      amplitudes in those derivations were simultaneously measured using automated 
      analysis in 29 patients. Each amplitude was divided by the average from the six 
      derivations, thus removing shared factors such as age, gender and sleep depth while 
      retaining factors that differ between the derivations such as caused by local skull 
      characteristics, electrode distance and neuronal dipole orientation. The remaining 
      inter-individual variability differed significantly and up to a factor of two 
      between the AASM derivations. The amplitudes differed significantly and up to 60% 
      between the AASM derivations, causing substantial scoring bias between centres using 
      different derivations. The resulting de-standardization most likely affects any 
      patient group because the amplitude differences were consistent over diagnoses, 
      genders, and age. Derivation-dependent amplitude thresholds were proposed to reduce 
      the scoring bias. However, it would be better to settle on just one derivation, for 
      instance Cz-Oz or Fpz-Cz because these have lowest variability while matching the 
      traditional C4-M1 amplitudes.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate if and how sleep physiology is affected 
      by naturally occurring high work stress and identify individual differences in the 
      response of sleep to stress. Probable upcoming stress levels were estimated through 
      weekly web questionnaire ratings. Based on the modified FIRST-scale (Ford insomnia 
      response to stress) participants were grouped into high (n = 9) or low (n = 19) 
      sensitivity to stress related sleep disturbances (Drake et al., 2004). Sleep was 
      recorded in 28 teachers with polysomnography, sleep diaries and actigraphs during 
      one high stress and one low stress condition in the participants home. EEG showed a 
      decrease in sleep efficiency during the high stress condition. Significant 
      interactions between group and condition were seen for REM sleep, arousals and stage 
      transitions. The sensitive group had an increase in arousals and stage transitions 
      during the high stress condition and a decrease in REM, whereas the opposite was 
      seen in the resilient group. Diary ratings during the high stress condition showed 
      higher bedtime stress and lower ratings on the awakening index (insufficient sleep 
      and difficulties awakening). Ratings also showed lower cognitive function and 
      preoccupation with work thoughts in the evening. KSS ratings of sleepiness increased 
      during stress for the sensitive group. Saliva samples of cortisol showed no effect 
      of stress. It was concluded that moderate daily stress is associated with a moderate 
      negative effect on sleep sleep efficiency and fragmentation. A slightly stronger 
      effect was seen in the sensitive group.

AB  - Both excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 
      deregulation are part of Parkinson's disease (PD) non-motor symptoms and may 
      complicate dopamine replacement therapy. We report here that dopamine agonists act 
      differentially on sleep architecture in the 
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine macaque monkey. Continuous sleep and 
      wake electroencephalographic monitoring revealed no effect of the selective dopamine 
      D2 receptor agonist quinpirole on EDS, whereas the selective dopamine D1 receptor 
      agonist SKF38393 efficiently alleviated EDS and restored REM sleep to baseline 
      values. The present results question the relevance of abandoning D1 receptor agonist 
      treatment in PD as it might actually improve sleep-related disorders.

TI  - Effects of acute microinjections of the thyroid hormone derivative 3-iodothyronamine

AB  - The decarboxylated thyroid hormone derivative 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM) has been 
      reported as having behavioral and physiological consequences distinct from those of 
      thyroid hormones. Here, we investigate the effects of T1AM on EEG-defined sleep 
      after acute administration to the preoptic region of adult male rats. Our laboratory 
      recently demonstrated a decrease in EEG-defined sleep after administration of 
      3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) to the same brain region. After injection of T1AM or 
      vehicle solution, EEG, EMG, activity, and core body temperature were recorded for 
      24h. Sleep parameters were determined from EEG and EMG data. Earlier investigations 
      found contrasting systemic effects of T3 and T1AM, such as decreased heart rate and 
      body temperature after intraperitoneal T1AM injection. However, nREM sleep was 
      decreased in the present study after injections of 1 or 3 μg T1AM, but not after 0.3 
      or 10 μg, closely mimicking the previously reported effects of T3 administration to 
      the preoptic region. The biphasic dose-response observed after either T1AM or T3 
      administration seems to indicate shared mechanisms and/or functions of sleep 
      regulation in the preoptic region. Consistent with systemic administration of T1AM, 
      however, microinjection of T1AM decreased body temperature. The current study is the 
      first to show modulation of sleep by T1AM, and suggests that T1AM and T3 have both 
      shared and independent effects in the adult mammalian brain.

AB  - The effect of mild sleep restriction on cognitive functioning in young children is 
      unclear, yet sleep loss may impact children's abilities to attend to tasks with high 
      processing demands. In a preliminary investigation, six children (6.6-8.3 years of 
      age) with normal sleep patterns performed three tasks: attention ("Oddball"), speech 
      perception (consonant-vowel syllables), and executive function (Directional Stroop). 
      Event-related potentials (ERPs) responses were recorded before (Control) and 
      following 1 week of 1-hour per day of sleep restriction. Brain activity across all 
      tasks following Sleep Restriction differed from activity during Control Sleep, 
      indicating that minor sleep restriction impacts children's neurocognitive 
      functioning.

PG  - 268-75, e169

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previously we have shown that, during sleep, electrical and magnetic 
      stimulation of areas of the stomach and small intestine evoked neuronal and EEG 
      responses in various cortical areas. In this study we wanted to correlate natural 
      myoelectrical activity of the duodenum with cortical neuronal activity, and to 
      investigate whether there is a causal link between them during periods of slow-wave 
      sleep. METHODS: We have recorded the myoelectrical activity from the wall of the 
      duodenum and activity of single neurons from three cortical visual areas in 
      naturally sleeping cats and investigated causal interrelationship between these 
      structures during slow-wave sleep. KEY RESULTS: About 30% of the cortical neurons 
      studied changed their firing rate dependent on the phases of the peristaltic cycle 
      and demonstrated selectivity to particular pattern of duodenal myoelectrical 
      activity during slow-wave sleep. This interrelationship was never seen when awake. 
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This observation supports the hypothesis that, during 
      sleep, the cerebral cortex switches from processing of exteroceptive and 
      proprioceptive information to processing of interoceptive information.

TI  - Double-layered models can explain macro and micro structure of human sleep.
PG  - 1350008
LID - 10.1142/S0129065713500081 [doi]
AB  - The model simulates the activity of three neural populations using a Lotka-Volterra 
      predator-prey system and, based on neuro-anatomical and neuro-physiological recent 
      findings, assumes that a functional thalamo-cortical gate should be crossed by 
      'queuing' thalamic signals and that a sleep promoting substance acts as a modulator. 
      The resultant activity accounts for the sleep stage transitions. In accordance with 
      sleep cycles timing, the model proves to be able to reproduce the clustering and 
      randomness of those peculiar transient synchronized EEG patterns (TSEP) described in 
      normal human sleep and supposed to be related to the dynamic building up of NREM 
      sleep until its stabilization against perturbations.

TI  - Vagotomy attenuates brain cytokines and sleep induced by peripherally administered 
      tumor necrosis factor-α and lipopolysaccharide in mice.
PG  - 1227-38, 1238A
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2892 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Systemic tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is linked to sleep and 
      sleep altering pathologies in humans. Evidence from animals indicates that systemic 
      and brain TNF-α have a role in regulating sleep. In animals, TNF-α or 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhance brain pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and 
      sleep after central or peripheral administration. Vagotomy blocks enhanced sleep 
      induced by systemic TNF-α and LPS in rats, suggesting that vagal afferent 
      stimulation by TNF-α enhances pro-inflammatory cytokines in sleep-related brain 
      areas. However, the effects of systemic TNF-α on brain cytokine expression and mouse 
      sleep remain unknown. DESIGN: We investigated the role of vagal afferents on brain 
      cytokines and sleep after systemically applied TNF-α or LPS in mice. MEASUREMENTS 
      AND RESULTS: Spontaneous sleep was similar in vagotomized and sham-operated 
      controls. Vagotomy attenuated TNF-α- and LPS-enhanced non-rapid eye movement sleep 
      (NREMS); these effects were more evident after lower doses of these substances. 
      Vagotomy did not affect rapid eye movement sleep responses to these substances. 
      NREMS electroencephalogram delta power (0.5-4 Hz range) was suppressed after 
      peripheral TNF-α or LPS injections, although vagotomy did not affect these 
      responses. Compared to sham-operated controls, vagotomy did not affect liver 
      cytokines. However, vagotomy attenuated interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and TNF-α mRNA 
      brain levels after TNF-α, but not after LPS, compared to the sham-operated controls. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that vagal afferents mediate peripheral TNF-α-induced brain 
      TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA expressions to affect sleep. We also conclude that vagal 
      afferents alter sleep induced by peripheral pro-inflammatory stimuli in mice similar 
      to those occurring in other species.

TI  - Relationship between delta power and the electrocardiogram-derived cardiopulmonary 
      spectrogram: possible implications for assessing the effectiveness of sleep.

LID - S1389-9457(13)01161-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.sleep.2013.10.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The physiologic relationship between slow-wave activity (SWA) (0-4 Hz) 
      on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and high-frequency (0.1-0.4 Hz) cardiopulmonary 
      coupling (CPC) derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) sleep spectrograms is not known. 
      Because high-frequency CPC appears to be a biomarker of stable sleep, we tested the 
      hypothesis that that slow-wave EEG power would show a relatively fixed-time 
      relationship to periods of high-frequency CPC. Furthermore, we speculated that this 
      correlation would be independent of conventional nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep 
      stages. METHODS: We analyzed selected datasets from an archived polysomnography 
      (PSG) database, the Sleep Heart Health Study I (SHHS-I). We employed the 
      cross-correlation technique to measure the degree of which 2 signals are correlated 
      as a function of a time lag between them. Correlation analyses between 
      high-frequency CPC and delta power (computed both as absolute and normalized values) 
      from 3150 subjects with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of ≤5 events per hour of sleep 
      were performed. RESULTS: The overall correlation (r) between delta power and 
      high-frequency coupling (HFC) power was 0.40±0.18 (P=.001). Normalized delta power 
      provided improved correlation relative to absolute delta power. Correlations were 
      somewhat reduced in the second half relative to the first half of the night 
      (r=0.45±0.20 vs r=0.34±0.23). Correlations were only affected by age in the eighth 
      decade. There were no sex differences and only small racial or ethnic differences 
      were noted. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a tight temporal relationship between 
      slow wave power, both within and outside conventional slow wave sleep periods, and 
      high frequency cardiopulmonary coupling, an ECG-derived biomarker of "stable" sleep. 
      These findings raise mechanistic questions regarding the cross-system integration of 
      neural and cardiopulmonary control during sleep.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine relationships between different physical activity (PA) 
      domains and sleep, and the influence of consistent PA on sleep, in midlife women. 
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: 339 women in the 
      Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Sleep Study (52.1 ± 2.1 y). INTERVENTIONS: 
      None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep was examined using questionnaires, diaries and 
      in-home polysomnography (PSG). PA was assessed in three domains (Active Living, 
      Household/Caregiving, Sports/Exercise) using the Kaiser Physical Activity Survey 
      (KPAS) up to 4 times over 6 years preceding the sleep assessments. The association 
      between recent PA and sleep was evaluated using KPAS scores immediately preceding 
      the sleep assessments. The association between the historical PA pattern and sleep 
      was examined by categorizing PA in each KPAS domain according to its pattern over 
      the 6 years preceding sleep assessments (consistently low, inconsistent/consistently 
      moderate, or consistently high). Greater recent Sports/Exercise activity was 
      associated with better sleep quality (diary "restedness" [P < 0.01]), greater sleep 
      continuity (diary sleep efficiency [SE; P = 0.02]) and depth (higher NREM delta 
      electroencephalographic [EEG] power [P = 0.04], lower NREM beta EEG power [P < 
      0.05]), and lower odds of insomnia diagnosis (P < 0.05). Consistently high 
      Sports/Exercise activity was also associated with better Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
      Index scores (P = 0.02) and higher PSG-assessed SE (P < 0.01). Few associations 
      between sleep and Active Living or Household/Caregiving activity (either recent or 
      historical pattern) were noted. CONCLUSION: Consistently high levels of recreational 
      physical activity, but not lifestyle- or household-related activity, are associated 
      with better sleep in midlife women. Increasing recreational physical activity early 
      in midlife may protect against sleep disturbance in this population.

AB  - Sleep is regulated by homeostatic mechanisms, and the low-frequency power in the 
      electroencephalogram (delta power) during non-rapid eye movement sleep reflects 
      homeostatic sleep need. Additionally, sleep is limited by circadian and 
      environmentally influenced arousal. Little is known, however, about the underlying 
      neural substrates for sleep homeostasis and arousal and about the potential link 
      between them. Here, we subjected C57BL/6 mice to 6 h of sleep deprivation using two 
      different methods: gentle handling and continual cage change. Both groups were 
      deprived of sleep to a similar extent (>99%), and, as expected, the delta power 
      increase during recovery sleep was quantitatively similar in both groups. However, 
      in a multiple sleep latency test, the cage change group showed significantly longer 
      sleep latencies than the gentle handling group, indicating that the cage change 
      group had a higher level of arousal despite the similar sleep loss. To investigate 
      the possible biochemical correlates of these behavioral changes, we screened for 
      arousal-related and sleep need-related phosphoprotein markers from the diencephalon. 
      We found that the abundance of highly phosphorylated forms of dynamin 1, a 
      presynaptic neuronal protein, was associated with sleep latency in the multiple 
      sleep latency test. In contrast, the abundance of highly phosphorylated forms of 
      N-myc downstream regulated gene 2, a glial protein, was increased in parallel with 
      delta power. The changes of these protein species disappeared after 2 h of recovery 
      sleep. These results suggest that homeostatic sleep need and arousal can be 
      dissociated behaviorally and biochemically and that phosphorylated N-myc downstream 
      regulated gene 2 and dynamin 1 may serve as markers of homeostatic sleep need and 
      arousal, respectively.

TI  - Almorexant promotes sleep and exacerbates cataplexy in a murine model of narcolepsy.
PG  - 325-36

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Humans with narcolepsy and orexin/ataxin-3 transgenic (TG) mice 
      exhibit extensive, but incomplete, degeneration of hypo-cretin (Hcrt) neurons. 
      Partial Hcrt cell loss also occurs in Parkinson disease and other neurologic 
      conditions. Whether Hcrt antagonists such as almorexant (ALM) can exert an effect on 
      the Hcrt that remains after Hcrt neurodegeneration has not yet been determined. The 
      current study was designed to evaluate the hypnotic and cataplexy-inducing efficacy 
      of a Hcrt antagonist in an animal model with low Hcrt tone and compare the ALM 
      efficacy profile in the disease model to that produced in wild-type (WT) control 
      animals. DESIGN: Counterbalanced crossover study. SETTING: Home cage. PATIENTS OR 
      PARTICIPANTS: Nine TG mice and 10 WT mice. INTERVENTIONS: ALM (30, 100, 300 mg/kg), 
      vehicle and positive control injections, dark/active phase onset. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      RESULTS: During the 12-h dark period after dosing, ALM exacerbated cataplexy in TG 
      mice and increased nonrapid eye movement sleep with heightened sleep/wake 
      fragmentation in both genotypes. ALM showed greater hypnotic potency in WT mice than 
      in TG mice. The 100 mg/kg dose conferred maximal promotion of cataplexy in TG mice 
      and maximal promotion of REM sleep in WT mice. In TG mice, ALM (30 mg/ kg) 
      paradoxically induced a transient increase in active wakefulness. Core body 
      temperature (Tb) decreased after acute Hcrt receptor blockade, but the reduction in 
      Tb that normally accompanies the wake-to-sleep transition was blunted in TG mice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These complex dose- and genotype-dependent interactions underscore the 
      importance of effector mechanisms downstream from Hcrt receptors that regulate 
      arousal state. Cataplexy promotion by ALM warrants cautious use of Hcrt antagonists 
      in patient populations with Hcrt neurodegeneration, but may also facilitate the 
      discovery of anticataplectic medications. CITATION: Black SW; Morairty SR; Fisher

TI  - Effects of long-term use of clonazepam on nonrapid eye movement sleep patterns in 
      rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to analyze in detail the characteristics of nonrapid eye movement 
      (NREM) sleep in drug-free patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior 
      disorder (iRBD). We compare drug-free iRBD patients to both normal controls and 
      drug-free patients with narcolepsy/RBD and evaluate the changes following the 
      long-term use of bedtime clonazepam. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Forty-six 
      participants were recruited: 15 with iRBD (13 men, 2 women; mean age, 
      65.8±4.39years), 13 with narcolepsy/RBD (10 men, 3 women; mean age, 63.0±6.73years), 
      and 18 normal controls (10 men, 8 women; mean age 69.4±7.72years). Sleep was video 
      polysomnographically recorded and the RBD severity scale (RBDSS) was obtained. Chin 
      electromyography (EMG) amplitude was quantitatively assessed and the atonia index 
      was computed. Additionally, NREM sleep instability was evaluated using an automatic 
      quantitative analysis. Participants with iRBD were re-evaluated after 2.75±1.62years 
      of regular therapy with 0.5 to 1-mg clonazepam at bedtime. RESULTS: Slow transient 
      electroencephalography (EEG) events were increased in iRBD and decreased in 
      narcolepsy/RBD, while fast transient events decreased in iRBD and increased in 
      narcolepsy/RBD. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep the atonia index was reduced 
      in both iRBD and narcolepsy/RBD groups and during NREM sleep atonia index was 
      increased in iRBD participants, remaining low in narcolepsy/RBD participants. After 
      long-term therapy with clonazepam, wakefulness after sleep onset was decreased 
      together with an increase in both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and sleep stage 2, in which 
      the latter reached statistical significance; sleep stages 1 and 2 instability 
      significantly decreased and the duration of EEG transients also slightly but 
      significantly decreased. Finally, chin tone was not modified by clonazepam. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that clonazepam modifies some aspects of NREM sleep 
      in iRBD participants with a decrease in its instability. Moreover, we also show that 
      a complex modification of sleep chin atonia exists in these participants, which also 
      involves NREM sleep; for iRBD more complex neuropathologic models encompassing REM 
      sleep and NREM sleep mechanisms are needed.

PG  - 1139-45
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.3152 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep bruxism (SB) is reported to vary in frequency over time. The 
      aim of this study was to assess the first night effect on SB. METHODS: A 
      retrospective polysomnographic (PSG) analysis was performed of data from a sample of 
      SB patients (12 females, 4 males; age range: 17-39 years) recorded in a sleep 
      laboratory over 2 consecutive nights. Sleep parameters and jaw muscle activity 
      variables (i.e., rhythmic masticatory muscle activity [RMMA]) for SB were quantified 
      and compared between the 2 nights. Subjects were classified into groups according to 
      severity of RMMA frequency, such as low frequency (2-4 episodes/h and/or < 25 
      bursts/h) and moderate-high frequency (≥ 4 episodes/h and ≥ 25 bursts/h). RESULTS: 
      Overall, no first night effects were found for most sleep variables. However, total 
      sleep time, sleep efficiency, and stage transitions showed significant time and 
      group interactions (repeated measures ANOVAs, p ≤ 0.05). The RMMA episode index did 
      not differ between the 2 nights, whereas the second night showed significantly 
      higher burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration (repeated measure 
      ANOVAs, p ≤ 0.05). Five patients of 8 in the low frequency group were classified 
      into the moderate-high frequency group on the second night, whereas only one patient 
      in the moderate-high frequency group moved to the low frequency group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in 
      young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording 
      may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA 
      frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the 
      patient's medical and dental history.

AB  - There is a need to understand the neural basis of performance deficits that result 
      from sleep deprivation. Performance monitoring tasks generate response-locked 
      event-related potentials (ERPs), generated from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) 
      located in the medial surface of the frontal lobe that reflect error processing. The 
      outcome of previous research on performance monitoring during sleepiness has been 
      mixed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate performance monitoring in a 
      controlled study of experimental sleep deprivation using a traditional Flanker task, 
      and to broaden this examination using a response inhibition task. Forty-nine young 
      adults (24 male) were randomly assigned to a total sleep deprivation or rested 
      control group. The sleep deprivation group was slower on the Flanker task and less 
      accurate on a Go/NoGo task compared to controls. General attentional impairments 
      were evident in stimulus-locked ERPs for the sleep deprived group: P300 was delayed 
      on Flanker trials and smaller to Go-stimuli. Further, N2 was smaller to NoGo 
      stimuli, and the response-locked ERN was smaller on both tasks, reflecting 
      neurocognitive impairment during performance monitoring. In the Flanker task, higher 
      error rate was associated with smaller ERN amplitudes for both groups. Examination 
      of ERN amplitude over time showed that it attenuated in the rested control group as 
      error rate increased, but such habituation was not apparent in the sleep deprived 
      group. Poor performing sleep deprived individuals had a larger Pe response than 
      controls, possibly indicating perseveration of errors. These data provide insight 
      into the neural underpinnings of performance failure during sleepiness and have 
      implications for workplace and driving safety.

TI  - Acquired auditory agnosia in childhood and normal sleep electroencephalography 
      subsequently diagnosed as Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a report of three cases.
PG  - 575-9
LID - 10.1111/dmcn.12025 [doi]
AB  - AIM:   We report three cases of Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) in children (two 
      females, one male) in whom diagnosis was delayed because the sleep 
      electroencephalography (EEG) was initially normal. METHOD:   Case histories 
      including EEG, positron emission tomography findings, and long-term outcome were 
      reviewed. RESULTS:   Auditory agnosia occurred between the age of 2 years and 
      3 years 6 months, after a period of normal language development. Initial awake and 
      sleep EEG, recorded weeks to months after the onset of language regression, during a 
      nap period in two cases and during a full night of sleep in the third case, was 
      normal. Repeat EEG between 2 months and 2 years later showed epileptiform discharges 
      during wakefulness and strongly activated by sleep, with a pattern of continuous 
      spike-waves during slow-wave sleep in two patients. Patients were diagnosed with LKS 
      and treated with various antiepileptic regimens, including corticosteroids. One 
      patient in whom EEG became normal on hydrocortisone is making significant recovery. 
      The other two patients did not exhibit a sustained response to treatment and 
      remained severely impaired. INTERPRETATION:   Sleep EEG may be normal in the early 
      phase of acquired auditory agnosia. EEG should be repeated frequently in individuals 
      in whom a firm clinical diagnosis is made to facilitate early treatment.

TI  - Epileptic seizures as condensed sleep: an analysis of network dynamics from 
      electroencephalogram signals.
PG  - 268-73
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12113 [doi]
AB  - Both deepening sleep and evolving epileptic seizures are associated with increasing 
      slow-wave activity. Larger-scale functional networks derived from 
      electroencephalogram indicate that in both transitions dramatic changes of 
      communication between brain areas occur. During seizures these changes seem to be 
      'condensed', because they evolve more rapidly than during deepening sleep. Here we 
      set out to assess quantitatively functional network dynamics derived from 
      electroencephalogram signals during seizures and normal sleep. Functional networks 
      were derived from electroencephalogram signals from wakefulness, light and deep 
      sleep of 12 volunteers, and from pre-seizure, seizure and post-seizure time periods 
      of 10 patients suffering from focal onset pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Nodes of the 
      functional network represented electrical signals recorded by single electrodes and 
      were linked if there was non-random cross-correlation between the two corresponding 
      electroencephalogram signals. Network dynamics were then characterized by the 
      evolution of global efficiency, which measures ease of information transmission. 
      Global efficiency was compared with relative delta power. Global efficiency 
      significantly decreased both between light and deep sleep, and between pre-seizure, 
      seizure and post-seizure time periods. The decrease of global efficiency was due to 
      a loss of functional links. While global efficiency decreased significantly, 
      relative delta power increased except between the time periods wakefulness and light 
      sleep, and pre-seizure and seizure. Our results demonstrate that both epileptic 
      seizures and deepening sleep are characterized by dramatic fragmentation of 
      larger-scale functional networks, and further support the similarities between sleep 
      and seizures.

TI  - Brainwave entrainment for better sleep and post-sleep state of young elite soccer 
      players - a pilot study.
PG  - 393-402
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2013.819384 [doi]
AB  - The effect of sleep deprivation on psychophysical performance and well-being is 
      comprehensively investigated. Research investigating the effect of improved sleep is 
      rare. Just as little exists about attempts to support athletic mental state and 
      performance by improving sleep quality. This study aims to investigate whether sleep 
      quality of top athletes can be improved by auditory brainwave entrainment and 
      whether this leads to enhancements of post-sleep psychophysical states. In a pilot 
      study, 15 young elite soccer players were stimulated for eight weeks during sleep 
      with binaural beats around 2-8 Hz. Once a week after wake-up, participants completed 
      three different questionnaires: a sleep diary, an adjective list for psychophysical 
      and motivational state, and a self-assessment questionnaire for sleep and awakening 
      quality. Fifteen sport students executed the same protocol sleeping on the same 
      pillow, but without stimulation. Subjective ratings of sleep and awakening quality, 
      sleepiness and motivational state were significantly improved only in the 
      intervention group, but did not impact their perceived physical state. In summary, 
      eight weeks of auditory stimulation with binaural beats improved perceived sleep 
      quality and the post-sleep state of athletes, whereas the effect on physical level 
      is assumed to occur in a time-delayed fashion. It seems to be worthwhile - to 
      further elaborate long-time effects and consequences on physical and mental 
      performance.

AB  - Even under thermoneutral conditions, skin temperature fluctuates spontaneously, most 
      prominently at distal parts of the body. These fluctuations were shown to be 
      associated with fluctuations in vigilance: mild manipulation of skin temperature 
      during nocturnal sleep affects sleep depth and the power spectral density of the 
      electroencephalogram (EEG), and fluctuations in skin temperature during daytime 
      wakefulness are related to sleep propensity and task performance. The association of 
      daytime skin temperature fluctuations with EEG markers of vigilance has not 
      previously been investigated. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the 
      association between daytime fluctuations in skin temperature with those in two 
      quantitative EEG measures: the power spectral density of background EEG, and the 
      event related potential (ERP) elicited by visual stimuli. High-density EEG and skin 
      temperature were obtained in eight healthy adults five times a day while they 
      performed a visual sustained-attention task. Assessments were made after a night of 
      normal sleep and after the challenge of a night of total sleep deprivation. 
      Fluctuations in the distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient measured from the 
      earlobe and mastoid were associated with fluctuations in parieto-occipital high beta 
      band (20-40 Hz) power of the pre-stimulus background EEG, but only after sleep 
      deprivation. The temperature fluctuations were moreover associated with fluctuations 
      in the latency of the P300 elicited by the stimulus. The findings demonstrate close 
      association between fluctuations in an autonomic correlate of the vigilance state 
      (i.e. the distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient), and fluctuations in central 
      nervous system correlates of the vigilance state (i.e. background EEG and ERP). The 
      findings are of theoretical and practical relevance for the assessment and 
      manipulation of vigilance.

TI  - A mechanism for upper airway stability during slow wave sleep.
PG  - 555-63
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2544 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The severity of obstructive sleep apnea is diminished (sometimes 
      markedly) during slow wave sleep (SWS). We sought to understand why SWS stabilizes 
      the upper airway. Increased single motor unit (SMU) activity of the major upper 
      airway dilating muscle (genioglossus) should improve upper airway stability. 
      Therefore, we hypothesized that genioglossus SMUs would increase their activity 
      during SWS in comparison with Stage N2 sleep. DESIGN: The activity of genioglossus 
      SMUs was studied on both sides of the transition between Stage N2 sleep and SWS. 
      SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine subjects (age 38 ± 13 yr, 17 
      males) were studied. INTERVENTION: SWS. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Subjects slept 
      overnight with fine-wire electrodes in their genioglossus muscles and with full 
      polysomnographic and end tidal carbon dioxide monitors. Fifteen inspiratory phasic 
      (IP) and 11 inspiratory tonic (IT) units were identified from seven subjects and 
      these units exhibited significantly increased inspiratory discharge frequencies 
      during SWS compared with Stage N2 sleep. The peak discharge frequency of the 
      inspiratory units (IP and IT) was 22.7 ± 4.1 Hz in SWS versus 20.3 ± 4.5 Hz in Stage 
      N2 (P < 0.001). The IP units also fired for a longer duration (expressed as a 
      percentage of inspiratory time) during SWS (104.6 ± 39.5 %TI) versus Stage N2 sleep 
      (82.6 ± 39.5 %TI, P < 0.001). The IT units fired faster during expiration in SWS 
      (14.2 ± 1.8 Hz) versus Stage N2 sleep (12.6 ± 3.1 Hz, P = 0.035). There was minimal 
      recruitment or derecruitment of units between SWS and Stage N2 sleep. CONCLUSION: 
      Increased genioglossus SMU activity likely makes the airway more stable and 
      resistant to collapse throughout the respiratory cycle during SWS.

TI  - Spindle frequency activity may provide lateralizing information in drug-resistant 
      nocturnal mesial frontal lobe epilepsy: a pilot study on the contribution of sleep 
      recordings.

AB  - PURPOSE: Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is characterized by sleep-related 
      paroxysmal motor attacks occurring almost exclusively during non-REM sleep. Surgical 
      treatment may relieve symptoms in drug-resistant patients. However, the 
      identification of the epileptogenic zone, the region to be resected, is frequently 
      challenging because of the absence of lateralizing and localizing information and 
      the lack of informative EEG correlates. The aim of this study was to find 
      asymmetries in the ictal activity that could provide information on the 
      lateralization of the epileptogenic zone. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed the 
      sleep EEG of four patients recorded prior to surgical intervention. The 
      epileptogenic zone was known, as these patients had subsequently undergone 
      successful surgery after bilateral intracerebral stereo-EEG investigation. Sleep EEG 
      during the ictal phase was compared with sleep EEG during the pre-ictal phase. 
      RESULTS: In all patients, electrical sources of sigma activity (12-16 Hz) exhibited 
      increased activity during the ictal phase which was higher in the epileptogenic 
      hemisphere. Conversely, increased delta activity (1-4 Hz) was predominant 
      contralateral to the epileptogenic focus in three of four patients. CONCLUSION: 
      Sigma activity may have a predictive role in the lateralization of the epileptogenic 
      zone and be useful during the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with NFLE.

TI  - Intact brown adipose tissue thermogenesis is required for restorative sleep 
      responses after sleep loss.
PG  - 984-98
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12463 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic signals related to feeding and body temperature regulation have profound 
      effects on vigilance. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a key effector organ in the 
      regulation of metabolism in several species, including rats and mice. Significant 
      amounts of active BAT are also present throughout adulthood in humans. The metabolic 
      activity of BAT is due to the tissue-specific presence of the uncoupling protein-1 
      (UCP-1). To test the involvement of BAT thermogenesis in sleep regulation, we 
      investigated the effects of two sleep-promoting stimuli in UCP-1-deficient mice. 
      Sleep deprivation by gentle handling increased UCP-1 mRNA expression in BAT and 
      elicited rebound increases in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep and rapid-eye-movement 
      sleep accompanied by elevated slow-wave activity of the electroencephalogram. The 
      rebound sleep increases were significantly attenuated, by ~ 35-45%, in 
      UCP-1-knockout (KO) mice. Wild-type (WT) mice with capsaicin-induced sensory 
      denervation of the interscapular BAT pads showed similar impairments in restorative 
      sleep responses after sleep deprivation, suggesting a role of neuronal 
      sleep-promoting signaling from the BAT. Exposure of WT mice to 35 °C ambient 
      temperature for 5 days led to increased sleep and body temperature and suppressed 
      feeding and energy expenditure. Sleep increases in the warm environment were 
      significantly suppressed, by ~ 50%, in UCP-1-KO animals while their food intake and 
      energy expenditure did not differ from those of the WTs. These results suggest that 
      the metabolic activity of the BAT plays a role in generating a metabolic environment 
      that is permissive for optimal sleep. Impaired BAT function may be a common 
      underlying cause of sleep insufficiency and metabolic disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether eliciting repetitive cortical and autonomic arousals 
      during sleep is able to induce the occurrence of periodic leg movements during sleep 
      (PLMS). METHODS: Fifteen normal subjects underwent one night of uninterrupted and 
      two sequential nights of experimental sleep fragmentation achieved by auditory and 
      mechanical stimuli eliciting frequent EEG arousals. Sleep was polygraphically 
      recorded and subsequently used to determine the frequency of arousals and occurrence 
      of leg movement (LM) activity during the first (baseline) and the second 
      fragmentation night. Also, heart rate variability parameters were obtained to assess 
      the autonomic changes induced by the stimulation. RESULTS: Sleep fragmentation was 
      associated with an increase in the arousal index, percentage of sleep stage 1, and 
      frequency of stage shifts. In addition, there was a decrease in sleep latency and in 
      percentage of slow-wave sleep. Moreover, a significant increase in heart rate 
      variability and especially of its sympathetic component, was also found. In 
      contrast, parameters of the leg movement activity showed no significant change 
      following experimental sleep fragmentation. The lack of an increase in leg movement 
      activity was also observed in one subject who demonstrated PLMS at baseline. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Experimental sleep fragmentation is not associated with an increase in 
      PLMS in normal young adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Artificial lighting has been beneficial to society, but unnecessary 
      light exposure at night may cause various health problems. We aimed to investigate 
      how whole-night bedside light can affect sleep quality and brain activity. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Ten healthy sleepers underwent two polysomnography (PSG) sessions, one 
      with the lights off and one with the lights on. PSG variables related to sleep 
      quality were extracted and compared between lights-off and lights-on sleep. Spectral 
      analysis was performed to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep 
      epochs to reveal any light-induced differences in background brain rhythms. RESULTS: 
      Lights-on sleep was associated with increased stage 1 sleep (N1), decreased 
      slow-wave sleep (SWS), and increased arousal index. Spectral analysis revealed that 
      theta power (4-8Hz) during REM sleep and slow oscillation (0.5-1Hz), delta (1-4Hz), 
      and spindle (10-16Hz) power during NREM sleep were decreased in lights-on sleep 
      conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Sleeping with the light on not only causes shallow sleep 
      and frequent arousals but also has a persistent effect on brain oscillations, 
      especially those implicated in sleep depth and stability. Our study demonstrates 
      additional hazardous effect of light pollution on health.

AB  - Sleep appears to be an independent risk factor of sudden unexpected death in 
      epilepsy (SUDEP). We retrospectively determined the periictal electrophysiological 
      characteristics of nocturnal and diurnal generalized convulsive seizures (GCSs) in 
      109 patients. Our data showed that preictal heart rate (HR) was significantly lower 
      in 46 patients with nocturnal GCSs than in 63 patients with diurnal GCSs (p=0.002). 
      However, there was no significant difference in postictal HR and respiratory rate 
      (RR), total seizure duration, total convulsive phase, tonic phase, and clonic phase. 
      Meanwhile, postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) was observed in 52.4% of the 
      patients with diurnal GCSs and 67.4% of the patients with nocturnal GCSs. Duration 
      of PGES was 38.2±17.3s in patients with diurnal GCSs and 49.5±21.7s in patients with 
      nocturnal GCSs. There was also no significant difference in the prevalence (p=0.118) 
      and duration (p=0.044, Bonferroni-corrected significant level: α=0.00625) of PGES in 
      the two patient groups. Therefore, there is no clear evidence to attribute the SUDEP 
      risk associated with sleep to postictal autonomic dysfunction and PGES, as compared 
      to wakefulness.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evolved from a simple method to stimulate 
      the motor cortex to an invaluable tool for multiple diagnostic, research, and 
      therapeutic applications. A further development of this noninvasive brain 
      stimulation technique is concomitant electroencephalographic (EEG) recording during 
      TMS. The theoretical underpinnings and the technological innovation of TMS-EEG 
      co-registration have opened new ways to study brain excitability in neurological 
      conditions previously investigated with conventional EEG alone. A further advance in 
      TMS research applications is the perturbational approach: magnetic pulses can 
      interfere not only with dynamic, often pathological rhythms in epilepsy or altered 
      consciousness states, but also modulate physiological states such as sleep and sleep 
      deprivation. So applied, TMS-EEG co-registration can reveal different 
      neurophysiological and behavioral patterns in the awake state, sleep or sleep 
      deprivation. In this review, we discuss the use of TMS and TMS-EEG co-registration 
      in epilepsy, a still rather limited although promising area of study.

AB  - GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous 
      system that has been strongly implicated in the regulation of sleep. GABA 
      transporter subtype 1 (GAT1) constructs high affinity reuptake sites for GABA and 
      regulates GABAergic transmission in the brain. However, the role of GAT1 in 
      sleep-wake regulation remains elusive. In the current study, we characterized the 
      spontaneous sleep-wake cycle and responses to sleep deprivation in GAT1 knock-out 
      (KO) mice. GAT1 KO mice exhibited dominant theta-activity and a remarkable reduction 
      of EEG power in low frequencies across all vigilance stages. Under baseline 
      conditions, spontaneous rapid eye movement (REM) sleep of KO mice was elevated both 
      during the light and dark periods, and non-REM (NREM) sleep was reduced during the 
      light period only. KO mice also showed more state transitions from NREM to REM sleep 
      and from REM sleep to wakefulness, as well as more number of REM and NREM sleep 
      bouts than WT mice. During the dark period, KO mice exhibited more REM sleep bouts 
      only. Six hours of sleep deprivation induced rebound increases in NREM and REM sleep 
      in both genotypes. However, slow wave activity, the intensity component of NREM 
      sleep was briefly elevated in WT mice but remained completely unchanged in KO mice, 
      compared with their respective baselines. These results indicate that GAT1 plays a 
      critical role in the regulation of REM sleep and homeostasis of NREM sleep.

AB  - Shortened nocturnal sleep impairs morning glucose tolerance. The underlying 
      mechanism of this effect is supposed to involve a reduced fraction of slow wave 
      sleep (SWS). However, it remains unanswered if impaired glucose tolerance occurs due 
      to specific SWS reduction or a general disturbance of sleep. Sixteen healthy men 
      participated in three experimental conditions in a crossover design: SWS 
      suppression, rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep disturbance, and regular sleep. 
      Selective sleep stage disturbance was performed by means of an acoustic tone (532Hz) 
      with gradually rising sound intensity. Blood concentrations of glucoregulatory 
      parameters were measured upon an oral glucose tolerance test the next morning. Our 
      data show that morning plasma glucose and serum insulin responses were significantly 
      increased after selective SWS suppression. Moreover, SWS suppression reduced 
      postprandial insulin sensitivity up to 20%, as determined by Matsuda Index. 
      Contrastingly, disturbed REM-sleep did not affect glucose homeostasis. We conclude 
      that specifically SWS reduction is critically involved in the impairment of glucose 
      tolerance associated with disturbed sleep. Therefore, glucose metabolism in subjects 
      predisposed to reduced SWS (e.g. depression, aging, obstructive sleep apnea, 
      pharmacological treatment) should be thoroughly monitored.

AB  - Deficits in sleep and circadian organization have been identified as common early 
      features in patients with Huntington's disease that correlate with symptom severity 
      and may be instrumental in disease progression. Studies in Huntington's disease gene 
      carriers suggest that alterations in the electroencephalogram may reflect underlying 
      neuronal dysfunction that is present in the premanifest stage. We conducted a 
      longitudinal characterization of sleep/wake and electroencephalographic activity in 
      the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease to determine whether analogous 
      electroencephalographic 'signatures' could be identified early in disease 
      progression. R6/2 and wild-type mice were implanted for electroencephalographic 
      recordings along with telemetry for the continuous recording of activity and body 
      temperature. Diurnal patterns of activity and core body temperature were 
      progressively disrupted in R6/2 mice, with a large reduction in the amplitude of 
      these rhythms apparent by 13 weeks of age. The diurnal variation in sleep/wake 
      states was gradually attenuated as sleep became more fragmented and total sleep time 
      was reduced relative to wild-type mice. These genotypic differences were augmented 
      at 17 weeks and evident across the entire 24-h period. Quantitative 
      electroencephalogram analysis revealed anomalous increases in high beta and gamma 
      activity (25-60 Hz) in all sleep/wake states in R6/2 mice, along with increases in 
      theta activity during both non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep and a 
      reduction of delta power in non-rapid eye movement sleep. These dramatic alterations 
      in quantitative electroencephalographic measures were apparent from our earliest 
      recording (9 weeks), before any major differences in diurnal physiology or 
      sleep/wake behaviour occurred. In addition, the homeostatic response to sleep 
      deprivation was greatly attenuated with disease progression. These findings 
      demonstrate the sensitivity of quantitative electroencephalographic analysis to 
      identify early pathophysiological alterations in the R6/2 model of Huntington's 
      disease and suggest longitudinal studies in other preclinical Huntington's disease 
      models are needed to determine the generality of these observations as a potential 
      adjunct in therapeutic development.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article summarizes the clinical and electrophysiologic 
      manifestations of nocturnal seizures, particularly nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy 
      (NFLE), parasomnias, and other disorders presenting with complex behaviors in sleep. 
      The evaluation and treatment of patients with complex nocturnal behaviors can be 
      challenging. While the differential diagnosis of sleep-related movements, including 
      physiologic and pathologic phenomena, is extensive, the focus of evaluation in 
      patients with complex nocturnal behaviors distinguishes between nocturnal seizures 
      and parasomnias. RECENT FINDINGS: Seizures in NFLE have a wide range of complexity 
      and severity, overlapping considerably with the disorders of arousal from non-REM 
      (NREM) sleep. Video polysomnography with EEG (VPSG-EEG) has identified key clinical 
      features useful in differentiating these disorders. A dysfunctional arousal 
      mechanism involving the cholinergic system is involved in the pathophysiology of the 
      autosomal dominant form of NFLE and NREM parasomnias. The high prevalence of 
      parasomnias in NFLE families further confounds their distinction. VPSG-EEG combines 
      PSG with comprehensive EEG to evaluate unexplained nocturnal behaviors when 
      epileptic seizures are suspected. This procedure provides improved detection of 
      interictal and ictal EEG abnormalities and time-synchronized correlation of clinical 
      and neurophysiologic phenomena. SUMMARY: The diagnosis of complex nocturnal 
      behaviors is among the most difficult to establish in sleep medicine clinics and 
      laboratories. VPSG-EEG is indicated in the evaluation of patients with complex 
      nocturnal behaviors when routine EEG is nondiagnostic. Ongoing research is necessary 
      to fully elucidate the pathophysiology of these disorders, which share a host of 
      clinical manifestations.

PG  - 1429-42
LID - 10.1007/s00221-013-3780-1 [doi]
AB  - Sleep deprivation impacts subjective mood states, but very little research has 
      examined the impact on processing emotional information. In the current study, we 
      investigated the impact of total sleep deprivation on neural responses to emotional 
      facial expressions as well as the accuracy and speed with which these faces were 
      categorized. Forty-nine participants completed two tasks in which they were asked to 
      categorize emotional facial expressions as Happy, Sad, Angry, or Fearful. They were 
      shown the 'full' expression of the emotions in one task and more subtle expressions 
      in a second task in which expressions were 'morphed' with neutral faces so that the 
      intensity of emotion varied. It was expected that sleep deprivation would lead to 
      greater reactivity (indexed by larger amplitude N170 event-related potentials), 
      particularly for negative and more subtle facial expressions. In the full face task, 
      sleep-deprived (SD) participants were significantly less accurate than controls (C) 
      at identifying Sad faces and slower to identify all emotional expressions. P1 was 
      smaller and N170 was larger for the SD compared to C group, but for all emotions, 
      indicating generalized impairment in low-level visual processing. In the more 
      difficult morphed face task, SD participants were less accurate than C participants 
      for Sad faces; as well, the group difference in reaction time was greatest for Sad 
      faces. For the SD group, N170 increased in amplitude with increasing perceptual 
      difficulty for the Fearful and Angry faces, but decreased in amplitude with 
      increasing difficulty for Sad faces. These data illustrate that sleep deprivation 
      led to greater neural reactivity for the threat-related negative emotions as they 
      became more subtle; however, there was a failure to engage these perceptual 
      resources for the processing of Sad faces. Sleep loss preferentially impacted the 
      processing of Sad faces; this has widespread implications for sleep-deprived groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inadequate self-reported sleep is related to high blood pressure (BP). 
      Our study investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between poor 
      sleep measured by in-home polysomnography (PSG) and BP. METHODS: Midlife 
      participants (132 black, 164 white, and 59 Chinese) were from the SWAN (Study of 
      Women's Health Across the Nation) ancillary sleep study. In-home PSG measured sleep 
      apnea, duration, efficiency, and electroencephalogram (EEG) total delta and beta 
      power during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Women subsequently were followed 
      annually for 4.5 (1-7)years for BP and hypertensive status (>140/90 mmHg or use of 
      antihypertensive medication). Covariates were age, race, site, and educational 
      attainment, with time-covariates of BP medications, body mass index, diabetes 
      mellitus (DM), cigarette smoking, and menopausal status. RESULTS: Sleep duration and 
      efficiency were unrelated to BP cross-sectionally or longitudinally in multivariate 
      models. Women with higher total beta power were more likely to be hypertensive at 
      the time of the sleep study; women with lower total delta power were more likely to 
      show increases in diastolic BP (DBP) and to be at risk for incident hypertension 
      across follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Low NREM delta power may be a risk factor for future 
      hypertension. Quantitative EEG measures are worthy of future investigations of 
      hypertension risk.

AB  - Fragmentation of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is well described in individuals 
      with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and likely has significant functional 
      consequences. Fear-conditioned rodents may offer an attractive model of the changes 
      in sleep that characterize PTSD. Following fear conditioning (FC), Wistar-Kyoto 
      (WKY) rats, a strain known to be particularly stress-sensitive, have increased REMS 
      fragmentation that can be quantified as a shift in the distribution of REMS episodes 
      towards the more frequent occurrence of sequential REMS (inter-REMS episode 
      interval≤3 min) vs. single REMS (interval>3 min). The α1 adrenoceptor antagonist 
      prazosin has demonstrated efficacy in normalizing sleep in PTSD. To determine the 
      utility of fear-conditioned WKY rats as a model of sleep disturbances typical of 
      PTSD and as a platform for the development of new treatments, we tested the 
      hypothesis that prazosin would reduce REMS fragmentation in fear-conditioned WKY 
      rats. Sleep parameters and freezing (a standard measure of anxiety in rodents) were 
      quantified at baseline and on Days 1, 7, and 14 following FC, with either prazosin 
      (0.01mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle injections administered prior to testing in a 
      between-group design. Fear conditioning was achieved by pairing tones with a mild 
      electric foot shock (1.0mA, 0.5s). One, 7, and 14 days following FC, prazosin or 
      vehicle was injected, the tone was presented, freezing was measured, and then sleep 
      was recorded from 11 AM to 3 PM. WKY rats given prazosin, compared to those given 
      vehicle, had a lower amount of seq-REMS relative to total REMS time 14 days after 
      FC. They also had a shorter non-REMS latency and fewer non-REMS arousals at baseline 
      and on Days 1 and 7 after FC. Thus, in FC rats, prazosin reduced both REMS 
      fragmentation and non-REMS discontinuity.

LID - 10.1111/jsr.12064 [doi]
AB  - A growing literature shows prominent sex effects for risk for post-traumatic stress 
      disorder and associated medical comorbid burden. Previous research indicates that 
      post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with reduced slow wave sleep, which may 
      have implications for overall health, and abnormalities in rapid eye movement sleep, 
      which have been implicated in specific post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, but 
      most research has been conducted in male subjects. We therefore sought to compare 
      objective measures of sleep in male and female post-traumatic stress disorder 
      subjects with age- and sex-matched control subjects. We used a cross-sectional, 
      2 × 2 design (post-traumatic stress disorder/control × female/male) involving83 
      medically healthy, non-medicated adults aged 19-39 years in the inpatient sleep 
      laboratory. Visual electroencephalographic analysis demonstrated that post-traumatic 
      stress disorder was associated with lower slow wave sleep duration (F(3,82)  = 7.63, 
      P = 0.007) and slow wave sleep percentage (F(3,82)  = 6.11, P = 0.016). There was 
      also a group × sex interaction effect for rapid eye movement sleep duration (F(3,82) 
       = 4.08, P = 0.047) and rapid eye movement sleep percentage (F(3,82)  = 4.30, 
      P = 0.041), explained by greater rapid eye movement sleep in post-traumatic stress 
      disorder females compared to control females, a difference not seen in male 
      subjects. Quantitative electroencephalography analysis demonstrated that 
      post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with lower energy in the delta 
      spectrum (F(3,82)  = 6.79, P = 0.011) in non-rapid eye movement sleep. Slow wave 
      sleep and delta findings were more pronounced in males. Removal of post-traumatic 
      stress disorder subjects with comorbid major depressive disorder, who had greater 
      post-traumatic stress disorder severity, strengthened delta effects but reduced 
      rapid eye movement effects to non-significance. These findings support previous 
      evidence that post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with impairment in the 
      homeostatic function of sleep, especially in men with the disorder. These findings 
      suggest that group × sex interaction effects on rapid eye movement may occur with 
      more severe post-traumatic stress disorder or with post-traumatic stress disorder 
      comorbid with major depressive disorder.

TI  - Kv2.2: a novel molecular target to study the role of basal forebrain GABAergic 
      neurons in the sleep-wake cycle.
PG  - 1839-48
LID - 10.5665/sleep.3212 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The basal forebrain (BF) has been implicated as an important brain 
      region that regulates the sleep-wake cycle of animals. Gamma-aminobutyric acidergic 
      (GABAergic) neurons are the most predominant neuronal population within this region. 
      However, due to the lack of specific molecular tools, the roles of the BF GABAergic 
      neurons have not been fully elucidated. Previously, we have found high expression 
      levels of the Kv2.2 voltage-gated potassium channel on approximately 60% of 
      GABAergic neurons in the magnocellular preoptic area and horizontal limb of the 
      diagonal band of Broca of the BF and therefore proposed it as a potential molecular 
      target to study this neuronal population. In this study, we sought to determine the 
      functional roles of the Kv2.2-expressing neurons in the regulation of the sleep-wake 
      cycle. DESIGN: Sleep analysis between two genotypes and within each genotype before 
      and after sleep deprivation. SETTING: Animal sleep research laboratory. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Adult mice. Wild-type and Kv2.2 knockout mice with C57/BL6 background. 
      INTERVENTIONS: EEG/EMG recordings from the basal state and after sleep-deprivation 
      which was induced by mild agitation for 6 h. RESULTS: Immunostaining of a marker of 
      neuronal activity indicates that these Kv2.2-expressing neurons appear to be 
      preferentially active during the wake state. Therefore, we tested whether 
      Kv2.2-expressing neurons in the BF are involved in arousal using Kv2.2-deficient 
      mice. BF GABAergic neurons exhibited augmented expression of c-Fos. These knockout 
      mice exhibited longer consolidated wake bouts than wild-type littermates, and that 
      phenotype was further exacerbated by sleep deprivation. Moreover, in-depth analyses 
      of their cortical electroencephalogram revealed a significant decrease in the 
      delta-frequency activity during the nonrapid eye movement sleep state. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results revealed the significance of Kv2.2-expressing neurons in the 
      regulation of the sleep-wake cycle.

      sleep: a diagnostic challenge.
PG  - 227-31
LID - 10.1177/1550059412466549 [doi]
AB  - Subclinical rhythmic electroencephalogram discharge of adults (SREDA) is an 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern of uncertain significance, which occurs without 
      any correlation with epilepsy. It resembles epileptiform activity, and is therefore 
      likely to be misinterpreted as an authentic epileptiform pattern. We describe the 
      occurrence of SREDA during stage II nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and discuss 
      the diagnostic difficulties that may arise when such a pattern is encountered during 
      sleep EEG recordings. SREDA may occur during sleep, leading to difficulties in 
      correct identification of this pattern, as the patient is unconscious and unable to 
      report any symptoms. Although there are rather distinctive EEG features, the lack of 
      changes in electrocardiogram rhythm and the absence of ocular/muscular artifacts 
      suggest a nonepileptic phenomenon. The ultimate diagnosis, and the correct 
      identification of SREDA, may be achieved by a comparison of EEG features between the 
      pattern occurring during sleep and that recorded in the awake state.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleepiness, cognitive deficits, abnormal event-related potentials (ERP), 
      and slowing of the waking electroencephalography (EEG) activity have been reported 
      in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Our study aimed at evaluating if an 
      association exists between the severity of ERP abnormalities and EEG slowing to 
      better understand cerebral dysfunctions in OSA. METHODS: Twelve OSA patients and 12 
      age-matched controls underwent an overnight polysomnographic recording, an EEG 
      recording of 10 min of wakefulness, and an auditory ERP protocol known to 
      specifically recruit attention. P300 and P3a ERP components were measured as well as 
      the spectral power in each frequency band of the waking EEG. Pearson product moment 
      correlations were used to measure associations between ERP characteristics and EEG 
      spectral power in OSA patients and control subjects. RESULTS: A positive correlation 
      between the late P300 amplitude and θ power in the occipital region was observed in 
      OSA subjects (P<.01). A positive correlation was also found between P3a amplitude 
      and β1 power in central region in OSA subjects (P<.01). No correlation was observed 
      for control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: ERP abnormalities observed in an attention task 
      are associated with a slowing of the waking EEG recorded at rest in OSA.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) 
      slowing have been reported as common findings of idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) 
      sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and α-synucleinopathies. The objective of this study 
      is to clarify the relation between MCI and physiological markers in iRBD. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Yoyogi Sleep Disorder Center. PATIENTS OR 
      PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one patients with iRBD including 17 younger patients with iRBD 
      (younger than 70 y) and 17 control patients for the younger patients with iRBD. 
      INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 
      and n-polysomnogram (PSG) were conducted of all participants. In patients with iRBD, 
      the factors associated with MCI were explored among parameters of REM sleep without 
      atonia (RWA), score of Sniffin' Sticks Test (threshold-discrimination-identification 
      [TDI] score), RBD morbidity, and RBD severity evaluated with the Japanese version of 
      the RBD questionnaire (RBDQ-JP). The younger iRBD group showed significantly lower 
      alpha power during wake and lower MoCA score than the age-matched control group. MCI 
      was detected in 13 of 17 patients (76.5%) on MoCA in this group. Among patients wtih 
      iRBD, the MoCA score negatively correlated with age, proportion of slow wave sleep, 
      TDI score, and EEG spectral power. Multiple regression analysis provided the 
      following equation: MoCA score = 50.871-0.116*age -5.307*log (δ power during REM 
      sleep) + 0.086*TDI score (R² = 0.598, P < 0.01). The standardized partial regression 
      coefficients were -0.558 for age, -0.491 for log (δ power during REM sleep), and 
      0.357 for TDI score (F = 9.900, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Electroencephalographic 
      slowing, especially during rapid eye movement sleep and olfactory dysfunction, was 
      revealed to be associated with cognitive decline in idiopathic rapid eye movement 
      sleep behavior disorder.

      models.
PG  - 101
LID - 10.1186/1471-2202-14-101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhythmic oscillatory activity is widely observed during a variety of 
      subject behaviors and is believed to play a central role in information processing 
      and control. A classic example of rhythmic activity is alpha spindles, which consist 
      of short (0.5-2 s) bursts of high frequency alpha activity. Recent research has 
      shown that alpha spindles in the parietal/occipital area are statistically related 
      to fatigue and drowsiness. These spindles constitute sharp changes in the underlying 
      statistical properties of the signal. Our hypothesis is that change point detection 
      models can be used to identify the onset and duration of spindles in EEG. In this 
      work we develop an algorithm that accurately identifies sudden bursts of narrowband 
      oscillatory activity in EEG using techniques derived from change point analysis. Our 
      motivating example is detection of alpha spindles in the parietal/occipital areas of 
      the brain. Our goal is to develop an algorithm that can be applied to any type of 
      rhythmic oscillatory activity of interest for accurate online detection. METHODS: In 
      this work we propose modeling the alpha band EEG time series using discounted 
      autoregressive (DAR) modeling. The DAR model uses a discounting rate to weigh points 
      measured further in the past less heavily than points more recently observed. This 
      model is used together with predictive loss scoring to identify periods of EEG data 
      that are statistically significant. RESULTS: Our algorithm accurately captures 
      changes in the statistical properties of the alpha frequency band. These statistical 
      changes are highly correlated with alpha spindle occurrences and form a reliable 
      measure for detecting alpha spindles in EEG. We achieve approximately 95% accuracy 
      in detecting alpha spindles, with timing precision to within approximately 150 ms, 
      for two datasets from an experiment of prolonged simulated driving, as well as in 
      simulated EEG. Sensitivity and specificity values are above 0.9, and in many cases 
      are above 0.95, for our analysis. CONCLUSION: Modeling the alpha band EEG using 
      discounted AR models provides an efficient method for detecting oscillatory alpha 
      activity in EEG. The method is based on statistical principles and can generally be 
      applied to detect rhythmic activity in any frequency band or brain region.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sleep 
      quality, and sleep disorders in a cohort of patients with epilepsy in the city of 
      Florianopolis in southern Brazil. One hundred and forty patients diagnosed with 
      epilepsy were assessed by questionnaires that included demographic and clinical 
      variables, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
      (ESS), the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), and the Fletcher & Luckett Adapted 
      Questionnaire (FLAQ). These data were then compared to data from a control group 
      (n=85). Compared to controls, patients with epilepsy (PWE) had significantly higher 
      scores on the ESS (p=0.003), higher scores on the "daytime dysfunction" domain of 
      the PSQI (p=0.002), and more symptoms that suggested obstructive sleep apnea in the 
      FLAQ (p<0.001). By performing multiple linear regression models, we demonstrated 
      that age, male gender, the presence of secondarily generalized seizures, and 
      phenobarbital use were slightly to moderately correlated with PSQI (r=0.38) and FLAQ 
      (r=0.51) but not with SSS scores. We concluded that PWE had more EDS, daytime 
      dysfunction, and sleep disorders compared to a control group.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the brain shows specific and predictable patterns 
      of spatial and temporal differences during sleep onset (SO) reflecting a temporal 
      uncoupling of electrical activity between different cortical regions and a 
      dissociated wakelike and sleeplike electrocortical activity in different cortical 
      areas. METHODS: We analyzed full-scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of 
      40 healthy subjects to investigate spatial and temporal changes of EEG activity 
      across the wake-sleep transition. We quantified EEG sleep recordings by a fast 
      Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm and by a better oscillation (BOSC) detection 
      method to the EEG signals, which measured oscillatory activity within a signal 
      containing a nonrhythmic portion. RESULTS: The most representative spatial change at 
      SO is the frontalization of slow-wave activity (SWA), while the θ activity, which 
      mostly shares a similar temporal and spatial pattern with SWA, exhibits a 
      temporo-occipital diffusion. The time course of these oscillations confirms that the 
      changes of the dominant waves coexist with topographic changes. The waking occipital 
      prevalence of α oscillations is progressively replaced by an occipital prevalence of 
      θ oscillations. On the other hand, more anterior areas show a wide synchronization 
      pattern mainly expressed by slow waves just below 4 Hz and by spindle oscillations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The whole pattern of results confirms that the centrofrontal areas 
      showed an earlier synchronization (i.e., they fall asleep first). This finding 
      implies a coexistence of wakelike and sleeplike electrical activity during sleep in 
      different cortical areas. It also implies that the process of progressive brain 
      disconnection from the external world as we fall asleep does not necessarily affect 
      primary and higher-order cortices at the same time.

AB  - During sleep, the brain network processes sensory stimuli without awareness. 
      Stimulation must affect differently brain networks in sleep versus wake, but these 
      differences have yet to be quantified. We recorded cortical activity in stage 2 
      (SII) sleep and wake using EEG while a tone was intermittently played. Zero-lag 
      correlation measured input to pairs of sensors in the network; cross-correlation and 
      phase-lag index measured pairwise corticocortical connectivity. Our analysis 
      revealed that under baseline conditions, the cortical network, in particular the 
      central regions of the frontoparietal cortex, interact at a characteristic latency 
      of 50 ms, but only during wake, not sleep. Nonsalient auditory stimulation causes 
      far greater perturbation of connectivity from baseline in sleep than wake, both in 
      the response to common input and corticocortical connectivity. The findings have key 
      implications for sensory processing.

AB  - Drivers are not always aware that they are becoming impaired as a result of 
      sleepiness. Using specific symptoms of sleepiness might assist with recognition of 
      drowsiness related impairment and help drivers judge whether they are safe to drive 
      a vehicle, however this has not been evaluated. In this study, 20 healthy volunteer 
      professional drivers completed two randomized sessions in the laboratory - one under 
      24h of acute sleep deprivation, and one with alcohol. The Psychomotor Vigilance Task 
      (PVT) and a 30min simulated driving task (AusEdTM) were performed every 3-4h in the 
      sleep deprivation session, and at a BAC of 0.00% and 0.05% in the alcohol session, 
      while electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movements were recorded. After each test 
      session, drivers completed the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and the Sleepiness 
      Symptoms Questionnaire (SSQ), which includes eight specific sleepiness and driving 
      performance symptoms. A second baseline session was completed on a separate day by 
      the professional drivers and in an additional 20 non-professional drivers for 
      test-retest reliability. There was moderate test-retest agreement on the SSQ 
      (r=0.59). Significant correlations were identified between individual sleepiness 
      symptoms and the KSS score (r values 0.50-0.74, p<0.01 for all symptoms). The 
      frequency of all SSQ items increased during sleep deprivation (χ(2) values of 
      28.4-80.2, p<0.01 for all symptoms) and symptoms were related to increased 
      subjective sleepiness and performance deterioration. The symptoms "struggling to 
      keep your eyes open", "difficulty maintaining correct speed", "reactions were slow" 
      and "head dropping down" were most closely related to increased alpha and theta 
      activity on EEG (r values 0.49-0.59, p<0.001) and "nodding off to sleep" and 
      "struggling to keep your eyes open" were related to slow eye movements (r values 
      0.67 and 0.64, p<0.001). Symptoms related to visual disturbance and impaired driving 
      performance were most accurate at detecting severely impaired driving performance 
      (AUC on ROC curve of 0.86-0.91 for detecting change in lateral lane position greater 
      than the change at a BAC of 0.05%). Individual sleepiness symptoms are related to 
      impairment during acute sleep deprivation and might be able to assist drivers in 
      recognizing their own sleepiness and ability to drive safely.

TI  - Gonadal steroid modulation of sleep and wakefulness in male and female rats is 
      sexually differentiated and neonatally organized by steroid exposure.
PG  - 204-14
LID - 10.1210/en.2013-1624 [doi]
AB  - The paucity of clinical and preclinical studies investigating sex differences in 
      sleep has resulted in mixed findings as to the exact nature of these differences. 
      Although gonadal steroids are known to modulate sleep in females, less is known 
      about males. Moreover, little evidence exists concerning the origin of these sex 
      differences in sleep behavior. Thus, the goal of this study was to directly compare 
      the sensitivity of sleep behavior in male and female Sprague Dawley rats to changes 
      in the gonadal steroid milieu and to test whether the sex differences in sleep are 
      the result of brain sexual differentiation or differences in circulating gonadal 
      steroids. Here we report the magnitude of change in sleep behavior induced by either 
      estradiol (E2) or testosterone (T) was greater in females compared with males, 
      suggesting that sleep behavior in females is more sensitive to the suppressive 
      effects of gonadal steroids. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the organizational 
      effects of early gonadal steroid exposure result in male-like responsivity to 
      gonadal steroids and directly alter the activity of the ventrolateral preoptic area 
      (VLPO), an established sleep-promoting nucleus, in adult masculinized females. 
      Moreover, the nonaromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone did not suppress sleep in 
      either males or females, suggesting that the T-mediated effect in females was due to 
      the aromatization of T into E2. Together our data suggest that, like sex behavior, 
      sex differences in sleep follow the classical organizational/activational effects of 
      gonadal steroids.

AB  - Mice are by far the most widely used species for scientific research and have been 
      used in many studies involving biopotentials, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      and electromyogram (EMG) signals monitored for sleep analysis. Unfortunately, 
      current methods for the analysis of these signals involve either tethered systems 
      that are restrictive and heavy for the animal or wireless systems that use 
      transponders that are large relative to the animal and require invasive surgery for 
      implantation; as a result, natural behavior/activity is altered. Here, we propose a 
      novel and inexpensive system for measuring electroencephalographic signals and other 
      biopotentials in mice that allows for natural movement. We also evaluate the new 
      system for the analysis of sleep architecture and EEG power during both spontaneous 
      sleep and the sleep that follows sleep deprivation in mice. Using our new system, 
      vigilance states including non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), rapid eye movement 
      sleep (REMS), and wakefulness, as well as EEG power and NREMS EEG delta power in the 
      0.5-4 Hz range (an indicator of sleep intensity) showed the diurnal rhythms 
      typically found in mice. These values were also similar to values obtained in mice 
      using telemetry transponders. Mice that used the new system also demonstrated 
      enhanced NREMS EEG delta power responses that are typical following sleep 
      deprivation and few signal artifacts. Moreover, similar movement activity counts 
      were found when using the new system compared to a wireless system. This novel 
      system for measuring biopotentials can be used for polysomnography, infusion, 
      microdialysis, and optogenetic studies, reduces artifacts, and allows for a more 
      natural moving environment and a more accurate investigation of biological systems 
      and pharmaceutical development.

TI  - Electroencephalographic profiles for differentiation of disorders of consciousness.
PG  - 109
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-12-109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electroencephalography (EEG) is best suited for long-term monitoring of 
      brain functions in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). Mathematical 
      tools are needed to facilitate efficient interpretation of long-duration sleep-wake 
      EEG recordings. METHODS: Starting with matching pursuit (MP) decomposition, we 
      automatically detect and parametrize sleep spindles, slow wave activity, K-complexes 
      and alpha, beta and theta waves present in EEG recordings, and automatically 
      construct profiles of their time evolution, relevant to the assessment of residual 
      brain function in patients with DOC. RESULTS: Above proposed EEG profiles were 
      computed for 32 patients diagnosed as minimally conscious state (MCS, 20 patients), 
      vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS, 11 patients) and 
      Locked-in Syndrome (LiS, 1 patient). Their interpretation revealed significant 
      correlations between patients' behavioral diagnosis and: (a) occurrence of sleep EEG 
      patterns including sleep spindles, slow wave activity and light/deep sleep cycles, 
      (b) appearance and variability across time of alpha, beta, and theta rhythms. 
      Discrimination between MCS and VS/UWS based upon prominent features of these 
      profiles classified correctly 87% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Proposed EEG profiles offer 
      user-independent, repeatable, comprehensive and continuous representation of 
      relevant EEG characteristics, intended as an aid in differentiation between VS/UWS 
      and MCS states and diagnostic prognosis. To enable further development of this 
      methodology into clinically usable tests, we share user-friendly software for MP 
      decomposition of EEG (http://braintech.pl/svarog) and scripts used for creation of 
      the presented profiles (attached to this article).

      hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons on regulation of sleep homeostasis and 
      sleep-wakefulness cycle recovery from experimental comatose state and 
      anesthesia-induced deep sleep.
PG  - 66-72
AB  - The work was aimed for the ascertainment of following question - whether 
      Orexin-containing neurons of dorsal and lateral hypothalamic, and brain Orexinergic 
      system in general, are those cellular targets which can speed up recovery of 
      disturbed sleep homeostasis and accelerate restoration of sleep-wakefulness cycle 
      phases during some pathological conditions - experimental comatose state and/or deep 
      anesthesia-induced sleep. Study was carried out on white rats. Modeling of 
      experimental comatose state was made by midbrain cytotoxic lesions at 
      intra-collicular level.Animals were under artificial respiration and special care. 
      Different doses of Sodium Ethaminal were used for deep anesthesia. 30 min after 
      comatose state and/or deep anesthesia induced sleep serial electrical stimulations 
      of posterior and/or perifornical hypothalamus were started. Stimulation period 
      lasted for 1 hour with the 5 min intervals between subsequent stimulations applied 
      by turn to the left and right side hypothalamic parts.EEG registration of cortical 
      and hippocampal electrical activity was started immediately after experimental 
      comatose state and deep anesthesia induced sleep and continued continuously during 
      72 hour. According to obtained new evidences, serial electrical stimulations of 
      posterior and perifornical hypothalamic Orexin-containing neurons significantly 
      accelerate recovery of sleep homeostasis, disturbed because of comatose state and/or 
      deep anesthesia induced sleep. Speed up recovery of sleep homeostasis was manifested 
      in acceleration of coming out from comatose state and deep anesthesia induced sleep 
      and significant early restoration of sleep-wakefulness cycle behavioral states.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Millions suffer from sleep disorders that often accompany severe 
      illnesses such as major depression; a leading psychiatric disorder characterized by 
      appetite and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) abnormalities. Melanin-concentrating 
      hormone (MCH) and nesfatin-1/NUCB2 (nesfatin) are strongly co - expressed in the 
      hypothalamus and are involved both in food intake regulation and depression. Since 
      MCH was recognized earlier as a hypnogenic factor, we analyzed the potential role of 
      nesfatin on vigilance. DESIGN: We subjected rats to a 72 h-long REMS deprivation 
      using the classic flower pot method, followed by a 3 h-long 'rebound sleep'. 
      Nesfatin mRNA and protein expressions as well as neuronal activity (Fos) were 
      measured by quantitative in situ hybridization technique, ELISA and 
      immunohistochemistry, respectively, in 'deprived' and 'rebound' groups, relative to 
      controls sacrificed at the same time. We also analyzed electroencephalogram of rats 
      treated by intracerebroventricularly administered nesfatin-1, or saline. RESULTS: 
      REMS deprivation downregulated the expression of nesfatin (mRNA and protein), 
      however, enhanced REMS during 'rebound' reversed this to control levels. 
      Additionally, increased transcriptional activity (Fos) was demonstrated in nesfatin 
      neurons during 'rebound'. Centrally administered nesfatin-1 at light on reduced REMS 
      and intermediate stage of sleep, while increased passive wake for several hours and 
      also caused a short-term increase in light slow wave sleep. CONCLUSIONS: The data 
      designate nesfatin as a potential new factor in sleep regulation, which fact can 
      also be relevant in the better understanding of the role of nesfatin in the 
      pathomechanism of depression.

TI  - Increased neural correlations in primate auditory cortex during slow-wave sleep.
PG  - 2732-8
LID - 10.1152/jn.00695.2012 [doi]
AB  - During sleep, changes in brain rhythms and neuromodulator levels in cortex modify 
      the properties of individual neurons and the network as a whole. In principle, 
      network-level interactions during sleep can be studied by observing covariation in 
      spontaneous activity between neurons. Spontaneous activity, however, reflects only a 
      portion of the effective functional connectivity that is activated by external and 
      internal inputs (e.g., sensory stimulation, motor behavior, and mental activity), 
      and it has been shown that neural responses are less correlated during external 
      sensory stimulation than during spontaneous activity. Here, we took advantage of the 
      unique property that the auditory cortex continues to respond to sounds during sleep 
      and used external acoustic stimuli to activate cortical networks for studying neural 
      interactions during sleep. We found that during slow-wave sleep (SWS), local 
      (neuron-neuron) correlations are not reduced by acoustic stimulation remaining 
      higher than in wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep and remaining similar to 
      spontaneous activity correlations. This high level of correlations during SWS 
      complements previous work finding elevated global (local field potential-local field 
      potential) correlations during sleep. Contrary to the prediction that slow 
      oscillations in SWS would increase neural correlations during spontaneous activity, 
      we found little change in neural correlations outside of periods of acoustic 
      stimulation. Rather, these findings suggest that functional connections recruited in 
      sound processing are modified during SWS and that slow rhythms, which in general are 
      suppressed by sensory stimulation, are not the sole mechanism leading to elevated 
      network correlations during sleep.

TI  - Fear extinction memory consolidation requires potentiation of pontine-wave activity 
      during REM sleep.
PG  - 4561-9
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5525-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - Sleep plays an important role in memory consolidation within multiple memory systems 
      including contextual fear extinction memory, but little is known about the 
      mechanisms that underlie this process. Here, we show that fear extinction training 
      in rats, which extinguished conditioned fear, increased both slow-wave sleep and 
      rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Surprisingly, 24 h later, during memory testing, 
      only 57% of the fear-extinguished animals retained fear extinction memory. We found 
      that these animals exhibited an increase in phasic pontine-wave (P-wave) activity 
      during post-training REM sleep, which was absent in the 43% of animals that failed 
      to retain fear extinction memory. The results of this study provide evidence that 
      brainstem activation, specifically potentiation of phasic P-wave activity, during 
      post-training REM sleep is critical for consolidation of fear extinction memory. The 
      results of this study also suggest that, contrary to the popular hypothesis of sleep 
      and memory, increased sleep after training alone does not guarantee consolidation 
      and/or retention of fear extinction memory. Rather, the potentiation of specific 
      sleep-dependent physiological events may be a more accurate predictor for successful 
      consolidation of fear extinction memory. Identification of this unique mechanism 
      will significantly improve our present understanding of the cellular and molecular 
      mechanisms that underlie the sleep-dependent regulation of emotional memory. 
      Additionally, this discovery may also initiate development of a new, more targeted 
      treatment method for clinical disorders of fear and anxiety in humans that is more 
      efficacious than existing methods such as exposure therapy that incorporate only 
      fear extinction.

      Re-Exposure during Sleep.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Studies suggest that sleep plays a role in traumatic memories and that 
      treatment of sleep disorders may help alleviate symptoms of posttraumatic stress 
      disorder. Fear-conditioning paradigms in rodents are used to investigate causal 
      mechanisms of fear acquisition and the relationship between sleep and posttraumatic 
      behaviors. We developed a novel conditioning stimulus (CS) that evoked fear and was 
      subsequently used to study re-exposure to the CS during sleep. METHODS: Experiment 1 
      assessed physiological responses to a conditioned stimulus (mild transient 
      hypercapnia, mtHC; 3.0% CO2; n = 17)+footshock for the purpose of establishing a 
      novel CS in male FVB/J mice. Responses to the novel CS were compared to 
      tone+footshock (n = 18) and control groups of tone alone (n = 17) and mild transient 
      hypercapnia alone (n = 10). A second proof of principle experiment re-exposed 
      animals during sleep to mild transient hypercapnia or air (control) to study sleep 
      processes related to the CS. RESULTS: Footshock elicited a response of acute 
      tachycardia (30-40 bpm) and increased plasma epinephrine. When tone predicted 
      footshock it elicited mild hypertension (1-2 mmHg) and a three-fold increase in 
      plasma epinephrine. When mtHC predicted footshock it also induced mild hypertension, 
      but additionally elicited a conditioned bradycardia and a smaller increase in plasma 
      epinephrine. The overall mean 24 hour sleep-wake profile was unaffected immediately 
      after fear conditioning. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates the efficacy of mtHC as 
      a conditioning stimulus that is perceptible but innocuous (relative to tone) and 
      applicable during sleep. This novel model will allow future studies to explore 
      sleep-dependent mechanisms underlying maladaptive fear responses, as well as 
      elucidate the moderators of the relationship between fear responses and sleep.

TI  - Emergence of sensory patterns during sleep highlights differential dynamics of REM 
      and non-REM sleep stages.
PG  - 14715-28
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0232-13.2013 [doi]
AB  - Despite the profound reduction in conscious awareness associated with sleep, sensory 
      cortex remains highly active during the different sleep stages, exhibiting complex 
      interactions between different cortical sites. The potential functional significance 
      of such spatial patterns and how they change between different sleep stages is 
      presently unknown. In this electrocorticography study of human patients, we examined 
      this question by studying spatial patterns of activity (broadband gamma power) that 
      emerge during sleep (sleep patterns) and comparing them to the functional 
      organization of sensory cortex that is activated by naturalistic stimuli during the 
      awake state. Our results show a high correlation (p < 10(-4), permutation test) 
      between the sleep spatial patterns and the functional organization found during 
      wakefulness. Examining how the sleep patterns changed through the night highlighted 
      a stage-specific difference, whereby the repertoire of such patterns was 
      significantly larger during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep compared with non-REM 
      stages. These results reveal that intricate spatial patterns of sensory functional 
      organization emerge in a stage-specific manner during sleep.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: An abnormality in auditory evoked responses localised to the inferior 
      colliculus (IC) has been reported in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour 
      disorder (RBD) patients. The external cortex of the inferior colliculus (ICX) has 
      been demonstrated not only to be involved in auditory processing, but also to 
      participate in the modulation of motor activity. METHODS: Rats were surgically 
      implanted with electrodes for electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography 
      (EMG) recording and guide cannulae aimed at the ICX for drug infusions. Drug 
      infusions were conducted after the animals recovered from surgery. Polysomnographic 
      recordings with video were analysed to detect normal and abnormal sleep states. 
      RESULTS: Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor agonist, infused 
      into the ICX increased phasic motor activity in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleep 
      and tonic muscle activity in REM sleep; it also elicited RBD-like activity during 
      the infusion and post-infusion period. In contrast, saclofen, a GABAB receptor 
      antagonist, did not produce significant changes in motor activities in sleep. 
      Baclofen infusions in ICX also significantly increased REM sleep during the 
      post-infusion period, while saclofen infusions did not change the amount of any 
      sleep-waking states. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that GABAB receptor mechanisms 
      in the ICX may be implicated in the pathology of RBD.

AB  - Studies in the literature data have shown that the prevalence of obstructive sleep 
      apnea (OSA) in children with epilepsy is high and that treatment for OSA leads to a 
      reduction in the number of seizures; by contrast, few studies have demonstrated an 
      increased prevalence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) or epilepsy in 
      children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The aim of the present study was to 
      confirm the high prevalence of IEDs or epilepsy in a large sample of children with 
      SDB and to collect follow-up data. Children were recruited prospectively and 
      underwent their first video-polysomnography (video-PSG) for SDB in a teaching 
      hospital sleep center. Of the 298 children who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for 
      sleep-disordered breathing, 48 (16.1%) children were found to have IEDs, three of 
      these 48 children were also found to have nocturnal seizures (two females diagnosed 
      with rolandic epilepsy and a male diagnosed with frontal lobe epilepsy). Only 11 
      subjects underwent a second video-PSG after 6months; at the second video-PSG, the 
      IEDs had disappeared in six subjects, who also displayed a reduced AHI and an 
      increased mean overnight saturation. Thirty-eight of the 250 children without IEDs 
      underwent a second video-PSG after 6months. Of these 250 children, four, who did not 
      display any improvement in the respiratory parameters and were found to experience 
      numerous stereotyped movements during sleep, were diagnosed with nocturnal frontal 
      lobe epilepsy. Our study confirms the high prevalence of IEDs in children with SDB. 
      Follow-up data indicate that they may recede over time, accompanied by an 
      improvement of sleep respiratory parameters.

AB  - We describe a novel approach to assess the excitability of hypoglossal motoneurons 
      in rats during naturally occurring states of sleep and wakefulness. Adult rats were 
      surgically prepared with permanently placed electrodes to record the EEG, EOG and 
      neck EMG. A stimulating/recording miniature tripolar cuff electrode was implanted 
      around the intact hypoglossal nerve and a head-restraining device was bonded to the 
      calvarium. After a period of adaptation to head-restraint, the animals did not 
      exhibit any sign of discomfort and readily transitioned between the states of 
      wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep. There was no spontaneous respiratory or tonic 
      activity present in the hypoglossal nerve during sleep or wakefulness. Hypoglossal 
      motoneurons were activated by electrical stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve 
      (antidromically) or by microstimulation directly applied to the hypoglossal nucleus. 
      Microstimulation of hypoglossal motoneurons evoked compound action potentials in the 
      ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve. The magnitude of their integrals tended to be higher 
      during wakefulness (112.6% ± 15; standard deviation) and were strongly depressed 
      during REM sleep (24.7% ± 3.4), compared to the integral magnitude during NREM 
      sleep. Lidocaine, which was delivered using pressure microinjection to the 
      microstimulation site, verified that the responses evoked in hypoglossal nerve can 
      be affected pharmacologically. We conclude that this animal model can be utilized to 
      study the neurotransmitter mechanisms that control the excitability of hypoglossal 
      motoneurons during naturally occurring states of sleep and wakefulness.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To search for early abnormalities in electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      during sleep which may precede motor symptoms in a transgenic mouse model of 
      hereditary neurodegenerative Huntington's disease (HD). DESIGN: In the R6/1 
      transgenic mouse model of HD, rhythmic brain activity in EEG recordings was 
      monitored longitudinally and across vigilance states through the onset and 
      progression of disease. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mice with chronic electrode 
      implants were recorded monthly over wake-sleep cycles (4 hours), beginning at 9-11 
      weeks (presymptomatic period) through 6-7 months (symptomatic period). Recording 
      data revealed a unique β rhythm (20-35 Hz), present only in R6/1 transgenic mice, 
      which evolves in close parallel with the disease. In addition, there was an unusual 
      relationship between this β oscillation and vigilance states: while nearly absent 
      during the active waking state, the β oscillation appeared with drowsiness and 
      during slow wave sleep (SWS) and, interestingly, strengthened rather than 
      dissipating when the brain returned to an activated state during rapid eye movement 
      (REM) sleep. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to providing a new in vivo biomarker and 
      insight into Huntington's disease pathophysiology, this serendipitous observation 
      opens a window onto the rarely explored neurophysiology of the cortico-basal ganglia 
      circuit during SWS and REM sleep.

TI  - Sleep spindles and rapid eye movement sleep as predictors of next morning cognitive 
      performance in healthy middle-aged and older participants.
PG  - 159-67
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12108 [doi]
AB  - Spindles and slow waves are hallmarks of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Both these 
      oscillations are markers of neuronal plasticity, and play a role in memory and 
      cognition. Normal ageing is associated with spindle and slow wave decline and 
      cognitive changes. The present study aimed to assess whether spindle and slow wave 
      characteristics during a baseline night predict cognitive performance in healthy 
      older adults the next morning. Specifically, we examined performance on tasks 
      measuring selective and sustained visual attention, declarative verbal memory, 
      working memory and verbal fluency. Fifty-eight healthy middle-aged and older adults 
      (aged 50-91 years) without sleep disorders underwent baseline polysomnographic sleep 
      recording followed by neuropsychological assessment the next morning. Spindles and 
      slow waves were detected automatically on artefact-free non-rapid eye movement sleep 
      electroencephalogram. All-night stage N2 spindle density (no./min) and mean 
      frequency (Hz) and all-night non-rapid eye movement sleep slow wave density 
      (no./min) and mean slope (μV/s) were analysed. Pearson's correlations were performed 
      between spindles, slow waves, polysomnography and cognitive performance. Higher 
      spindle density predicted better performance on verbal learning, visual attention 
      and verbal fluency, whereas spindle frequency and slow wave density or slope 
      predicted fewer cognitive performance variables. In addition, rapid eye movement 
      sleep duration was associated with better verbal learning potential. These results 
      suggest that spindle density is a marker of cognitive functioning in older adults 
      and may reflect neuroanatomic integrity. Rapid eye movement sleep may be a marker of 
      age-related changes in acetylcholine transmission, which plays a role in new 
      information encoding.

      antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). In 
      rats, ketamine selectively increased electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity 
      (SWA) during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and altered central brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that 
      higher SWA and BDNF levels may respectively represent electrophysiological and 
      molecular correlates of mood improvement following ketamine treatment. This study 
      investigated the acute effects of a single ketamine infusion on depressive symptoms, 
      EEG SWA, individual slow wave parameters (surrogate markers of central synaptic 
      plasticity) and plasma BDNF (a peripheral marker of plasticity) in 30 patients with 
      treatment-resistant MDD. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores rapidly 
      decreased following ketamine. Compared to baseline, BDNF levels and early sleep SWA 
      (during the first non-REM episode) increased after ketamine. The occurrence of high 
      amplitude waves increased during early sleep, accompanied by an increase in slow 
      wave slope, consistent with increased synaptic strength. Changes in BDNF levels were 
      proportional to changes in EEG parameters. Intriguingly, this link was present only 
      in patients who responded to ketamine treatment, suggesting that enhanced synaptic 
      plasticity - as reflected by increased SWA, individual slow wave parameters and 
      plasma BDNF - is part of the physiological mechanism underlying the rapid 
      antidepressant effects of NMDA antagonists. Further studies are required to confirm 
      the link found here between behavioural and synaptic changes, as well as to test the 
      reliability of these central and peripheral biomarkers of rapid antidepressant 
      response.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a type of REM 
      parasomnia characterized by complex motor activity during REM sleep. In this study, 
      cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) in patients with idiopathic RBD was analyzed to 
      evaluate the expression of arousal instability of NREM sleep. METHODS: A total of 31 
      idiopathic RBD patients and age- and gender-matched 21 control subjects were 
      consecutively recruited. Conventional sleep polysomnographic recording parameters 
      and CAP parameters were compared between RBD and the control group. RESULTS: The 
      number of CAP cycles (120.13 ± 113.56, p = 0.007), CAP sequences (20.9 ± 18.15, 
      p < 0.001), CAP index (25.14 ± 24.44, p = 0.017), and CAP rate (24.07 ± 13.22, 
      p = 0.016) were all significantly higher in RBD patients compared to the control 
      group. The increase in CAP sequences was observed in phase A2 and A3 subtypes while 
      phase A1 subtype was significantly lower in RBD patients. A significant positive 
      correlation was observed between disease duration with total CAP time (r = 0.289, 
      p = 0.042) and A3 index (r = 0.32, p = 0.024). There was a negative correlation 
      between the age and A1 index (r = -0.4491, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge 
      this is the first polysomnographic clinical study which evaluated CAP parameters in 
      RBD. Increased CAP rate found may be considered as a sign showing that NREM sleep 
      may also be affected in RBD patients. Therefore, CAP analysis may be important to 
      enlighten the pathogenesis of parasomnias.

AB  - Substance abuse and sleep deprivation are major problems in our society. Clinical 
      studies suggest that measures of poor sleep quality effectively predict relapse to 
      substance abuse. Previously, our laboratory has shown that acute sleep deprivation 
      increases the rate and efficiency (i.e., the goal-directed nature of responding) of 
      cocaine self-administration using a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of 
      reinforcement. However, the problem of sleep deprivation in our nation is largely 
      one of chronicity. Therefore, the current study used a rodent model of chronic sleep 
      restriction more akin to that experienced by humans (approximately 25% reduction in 
      baseline sleep over the course of 8 days) to assess the impact of chronic sleep 
      deprivation on cocaine-seeking and cocaine-taking behaviors in rats early during 
      acquisition of self-administration. While low drug-taking rats were unaffected by 
      chronic sleep restriction, high drug-takers in the chronic sleep restriction (CSR) 
      group exhibited enhanced fixed ratio (FR) responding by the fourth day of FR 
      training and significantly higher PR breakpoints than their non-sleep restriction 
      (NSR) counterparts. This study is the first to directly assess the impact of chronic 
      sleep deprivation on drug self-administration. These results show that chronic sleep 
      deprivation early during acquisition of self-administration has a significant effect 
      on the perceived incentive reward value of cocaine in high drug-takers, as indicated 
      by both increased FR responding and an increased willingness to work for drug. Thus, 
      it is important to be mindful of such factors in clinical settings designed for 
      treatment of addiction and relapse prevention.

      sleep in apnoeic patients.

LID - 10.1113/expphysiol.2013.073072 [doi]
AB  - What is the central question of this study? A transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS)-induced twitch applied on isolated single breaths over the motor cortex 
      somatotopic representation of the tongue briefly recruits submental muscles and 
      improves airflow dynamics of flow-limited respiratory cycles without arousing sleep 
      apnoea patients. However, the mechanical impact of the TMS-induced twitch applied 
      during consecutive breathing cycles on airflow dynamics remains unknown. What is the 
      main finding and what is its importance? Our results show that application of TMS 
      with the stimulator output set at the sleep submental motor threshold intensity on 
      consecutive respiratory cycles increases inspiratory flow and reduces the turbulent 
      airflow component. These results indicate an improvement of airflow pattern after 
      two single consecutive TMS-induced twitches without arousing sleep apnoea patients. 
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced twitches applied on isolated breaths 
      briefly recruit upper airway dilator muscles and improve airflow and inspiratory 
      volume without arousing apnoeic patients from sleep, but the effects of applying 
      such twitches consecutively on airflow dynamics is unknown. The objective of this 
      study was to quantify the effects of five consecutive TMS-induced twitches applied 
      on sleep-induced obstructive hypopnoeic breaths in 10 obstructive sleep apnoea 
      patients. Submental muscle motor threshold (SUBMT) and motor-evoked potential were 
      measured during wakefulness and sleep. The TMS-induced twitches were applied during 
      stable non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, at the beginning of inspiration of 
      consecutive flow-limited respiratory cycles, with the stimulator output set at sleep 
      SUBMT. Maximal inspiratory flow, inspiratory volume, inspiratory time, shifts of 
      electroencephalogram frequency and pulse rate variability were assessed. During 
      sleep, SUBMT increased (wakefulness, 25.3 ± 4.9%; NREM sleep, 27.0 ± 6.2%; P = 
      0.02). During each series of stimulations there was a rise in maximal inspiratory 
      flow (from 306.7 ± 123.2 to 359.8 ± 154.1 ml s(-1); P = 0.0002) and in inspiratory 
      volume (from 346.1 ± 128.1 to 414.9 ± 171.2 ml; P = 0.02) without differences in 
      thoraco-abdominal efforts and inspiratory time. These responses were observed in the 
      absence of arousals and ceased immediately after TMS interruption. Transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation-induced cortical and/or autonomic arousal was observed in 30.2% 
      of all series of stimulation. Consecutive twitch TMS of submental muscles may lead 
      to arousals in a minority of patients but can be applied on consecutive respiratory 
      cycles during sleep and can significantly improve maximal inspiratory flow and 
      inspiratory volume of flow-limited cycles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings varies widely 
      among laboratories. Although several recommendations had been published, there are 
      no previous studies directly addressing this. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To assess the 
      effect of the recording duration on detection of EEG abnormalities in a tertiary 
      referral centre for epilepsy. METHODS: We have reviewed 1005 EEG recordings and 
      determined the shortest recording duration necessary to identify interictal EEG 
      abnormalities. RESULTS: Standard, awake recordings shorter than 20 min yielded a 
      significantly lower incidence of abnormal findings as compared to longer recordings. 
      Although there was an increase in the diagnostic yield from 30 to 180 min recording 
      duration, this failed to reach the level of significance. For sleep recordings, 
      there was no significant increase in the diagnostic yield beyond 30 min. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for recommending at least 20 min recording 
      duration for standard awake EEGs and 30 min for sleep EEG recordings. As data were 
      derived from patients referred to our epilepsy centre, the results are only valid 
      for epilepsy-related indications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) promotes physiological stability and 
      interaction between parents and infants. Temporal analyses of predictability in 
      EEG-sleep time series can elucidate functional brain maturation between SSC and 
      non-SSC cohorts at similar post-menstrual ages (PMAs). METHODS: Sixteen EEG-sleep 
      studies were performed on eight preterm infants who received 8 weeks of SSC, and 
      compared with two non-SSC cohorts at term (N=126) that include a preterm group 
      corrected to term age and a full term group. Two time series measures of 
      predictability were used for comparisons. RESULTS: The SSC premature neonate group 
      had increased complexity when compared to the non-SSC premature neonate group at the 
      same PMA. Discriminant analysis shows that SSC neonates at 40 weeks PMA are closer 
      to the full term neonate non-SSC group than to the premature non-SSC group at the 
      same PMA; suggesting that the KC intervention accelerates neurophysiological 
      maturation of premature neonates. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the hypothesis that 
      EEG-derived complexity increases with neurophysiological maturation as supported by 
      previously published research, SSC accelerates brain maturation in healthy preterm 
      infants as quantified by time series measures of predictability when compared to a 
      similar non-SSC group. SIGNIFICANCE: Times series methods that quantify 
      predictability of EEG sleep in neonates can provide useful information about altered 
      neural development after developmental care interventions such as SSC. Analyses of 
      this type may be helpful in assessing other neuroprotection strategies.

TI  - Duration of activity and mode of action of modafinil: Studies on sleep and 
      wakefulness in humans.
PG  - 643-54
LID - 10.1177/0269881113508173 [doi]
AB  - The duration of activity of modafinil was investigated in healthy male volunteers in 
      two double-blind crossover studies. Mode of action was explored using a statistical 
      model concerned with the relationship between total sleep duration and that of rapid 
      eye movement (REM) sleep. Nocturnal sleep (23:00-07:00) followed by next-day 
      performance (09:00-17:00) was studied in 12 subjects administered 100, 200, 300 mg 
      modafinil and placebo, 0.5 h before bedtime. Performance overnight (19:00-08:45) 
      followed by sleep (09:15-15:15) was studied in nine subjects administered 100, 200, 
      300, 400 mg modafinil, 300 mg caffeine and placebo at 22:15. Modafinil 
      dose-dependently reduced sleep duration (nocturnal: 200 mg, p<0.05; 300 mg, p<0.001; 
      morning: 300 and 400 mg, p<0.05) and REM sleep (nocturnal: 300 mg; morning: 400 mg; 
      p<0.05). The statistical model revealed that reduced REM sleep was due to alerting 
      activity, with no evidence of direct suppression of REM sleep, suggesting 
      dopaminergic activity. Enhanced performance with modafinil during overnight work 
      varied with dose (200 mg>100 mg; 300, 400 mg>200, 100 mg, caffeine). However, in the 
      study of next-day performance, the enhancement was attenuated at the highest dose 
      (300 mg) by the greater disturbance of prior sleep. These findings indicate that 
      modafinil has a long duration of action, with alerting properties arising 
      predominantly from dopaminergic activity.

AB  - Cardiopulmonary dysfunction and postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) are 
      proposed as possible risk factors for the occurrence of SUDEP. The evolution of 
      cardiorespiratory abnormalities with seizures has not been systematically studied 
      for any age-related findings. Additionally, not many studies have looked into the 
      possible effect of age-related brain maturation on PGES. The purpose of this study 
      was to compare these SUDEP risk factors in adults versus children. We prospectively 
      recorded cardiopulmonary abnormalities during seizures using pulse oximetry, EKG, 
      and respiratory inductance plethysmography. Linear and logistic regression models 
      adjusting for multiple seizures in a single patient were used to compare the 
      cardiorespiratory and EEG findings between adults and children. We recorded 101 
      seizures in 26 children and 55 seizures in 22 adults. Ictal central apnea and 
      bradycardia occurred more often in children than in adults (p=0.02 and p=0.008, 
      respectively), while ictal tachycardia occurred more often in adults (p=0.001) than 
      in children. Postictal generalized EEG suppression of longer duration occurred more 
      often in adults (p=0.003) than in children. Minimum O2 saturation and seizure 
      duration/generalization/lateralization did not significantly differ between adults 
      and children (p>0.1). Children had more frontal lobe seizures, and adults had more 
      temporal lobe seizures recorded (p=0.01). There may be an age-related effect on 
      cardiorespiratory and EEG abnormalities associated with seizures, with higher rates 
      of apnea and bradycardia in children and a much higher prevalence of PGES of longer 
      duration in adults. This may indicate why, despite lower rates of cardiopulmonary 
      dysfunction, adults die more frequently from SUDEP than children.

TI  - Activation of 5-HT6 receptors modulates sleep-wake activity and hippocampal theta 
      oscillation.
PG  - 191-9
LID - 10.1021/cn300184t [doi]
AB  - The modulatory role of 5-HT neurons and a number of different 5-HT receptor subtypes 
      has been well documented in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles and hippocampal 
      activity. A high level of 5-HT(6) receptor expression is present in the rat 
      hippocampus. Further, hippocampal function has been shown to be modulated by both 
      5-HT(6) agonists and antagonists. In the current study, the potential involvement of 
      5-HT(6) receptors in the control of hippocampal theta rhythms and sleep-wake cycles 
      has been investigated. Hippocampal activity was recorded by intracranial hippocampal 
      electrodes both in anesthetized (n = 22) and in freely moving rats (n = 9). Theta 
      rhythm was monitored in different sleep-wake states in freely moving rats and was 
      elicited by stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation under anesthesia. 
      Changes in theta frequency and power were analyzed before and after injection of the 
      5-HT(6) antagonist (SAM-531) and the 5-HT(6) agonist (EMD386088). In freely moving 
      rats, EMD386088 suppressed sleep for several hours and significantly decreased theta 
      peak frequency, while, in anesthetized rats, EMD386088 had no effect on theta power 
      but significantly decreased theta frequency, which could be blocked by 
      coadministration of SAM-531. SAM-531 alone did not change sleep-wake patterns and 
      had no effect on theta parameters in both unanesthetized and anesthetized rats. 
      Decreases in theta frequency induced by the 5-HT(6) receptor agonist correspond to 
      previously described electrophysiological patterns shared by all anxiolytic drugs, 
      and it is in line with its behavioral anxiolytic profile. The 5-HT(6) antagonist, 
      however, failed to potentiate theta power, which is characteristic of many 
      pro-cognitive substances, indicating that 5-HT(6) receptors might not tonically 
      modulate hippocampal oscillations and sleep-wake patterns.

AB  - Accuracy and limitations of automatic scoring of sleep stages and 
      electroencephalogram arousals from a single derivation (Fp1 -Fp2 ) were studied in 
      29 healthy adults using a portable wireless polysomnographic recorder. All 
      recordings were scored five times: twice by a referent scorer who viewed the 
      standard polysomnographic montage and observed the American Academy of Sleep 
      Medicine rules (referent scoring and blind rescoring); and once by the same scorer 
      who viewed only the Fp1 -Fp2 signal (alternative scoring), by another expert from 
      the same institution, and by the algorithm. Automatic, alternative and independent 
      expert scoring were compared with the referent scoring on an epoch-by-epoch basis. 
      The algorithm's agreement with the reference (81.0%, Cohen's κ = 0.75) was 
      comparable to the inter-rater agreement (83.3%, Cohen's κ = 0.78) or agreement 
      between the referent scoring and manual scoring of the frontopolar derivation 
      (80.7%, Cohen's κ = 0.75). Most misclassifications by the algorithm occurred during 
      uneventful wake/sleep transitions, whereas cortical arousals, rapid eye movement and 
      stable non-rapid eye movement sleep were detected accurately. The algorithm yielded 
      accurate estimates of total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, arousal 
      indices and times spent in different stages. The findings affirm the utility of 
      automatic scoring of stages and arousals from a single frontopolar derivation as a 
      method for assessment of sleep architecture in healthy adults.

AB  - In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), occurrence of seizures and epileptiform EEG 
      discharges is influenced by internal and external factors. The most important 
      internal factor is the chronodependency: the occurrence of myoclonic jerks in the 
      early morning is one of the hallmarks of JME. Approximately two-thirds of the 
      patients with JME report that seizures are provoked by a variety of general factors 
      like stress, fatigue, fever, and sleep and more specific precipitants like flashing 
      sunlight, music, reading, thinking, and excess alcohol. The prevalence rate of 
      photosensitivity (photoparoxysmal EEG response) in patients with JME ranges from 8 
      to 90%; it is seen more often in females and adolescents and depends on drug use. 
      Since both JME and photosensitivity are connected with generalized types of epilepsy 
      and myoclonus, the two traits are comorbid for that reason. Epileptiform EEG 
      discharges can be provoked by other activation methods: sleep, hyperventilation, and 
      specific cognitive tasks. Attention seems to have a non-specific, inhibitory effect 
      of the epileptiform discharges. Hyperventilation can induce absence seizures in 
      patients with JME, while cognitive tasks are efficient in precipitating myoclonic 
      seizures. This article is part of a supplemental special issue entitled Juvenile 
      Myoclonic Epilepsy: What is it Really?

AB  - The cingulate cortex is regarded as the backbone of structural and functional 
      connectivity of the brain. While its functional connectivity has been intensively 
      studied, little is known about its effective connectivity, its modulation by 
      behavioral states, and its involvement in cognitive performance. Given the 
      previously reported effects on cingulate functional connectivity, we investigated 
      how eye-closure and sleep deprivation changed cingulate effective connectivity, 
      estimated from resting-state high-density electroencephalography (EEG) using a novel 
      method to calculate Granger Causality directly in source space. Effective 
      connectivity along the cingulate cortex was dominant in the forward direction. 
      Eyes-open connectivity in the forward direction was greater compared to eyes-closed, 
      in well-rested participants. The difference between eyes-open and eyes-closed 
      connectivity was attenuated and no longer significant after sleep deprivation. 
      Individual variability in the forward connectivity after sleep deprivation predicted 
      subsequent task performance, such that those subjects who showed a greater increase 
      in forward connectivity between the eyes-open and the eyes-closed periods also 
      performed better on a sustained attention task. Effective connectivity in the 
      opposite, backward, direction was not affected by whether the eyes were open or 
      closed or by sleep deprivation. These findings indicate that the effective 
      connectivity from posterior to anterior cingulate regions is enhanced when a 
      well-rested subject has his eyes open compared to when they are closed. Sleep 
      deprivation impairs this directed information flow, proportional to its deleterious 
      effect on vigilance. Therefore, sleep may play a role in the maintenance of waking 
      effective connectivity.

AB  - The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Commission report on classification 
      and terminology indicates that "diagnosing an individual as having an 
      encephalopathic course requires demonstration of a failure to develop as expected 
      relative to the same-aged peers or to regress in abilities." In this chapter, basing 
      our discussion on the theoretical framework of neuroconstructivism, on the latest 
      results deriving from functional neuroimaging and on the concept of system epilepsy, 
      we use continuous spike-waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS) as an example of how 
      non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep spikes interfere with the organization and 
      consolidation of neuropsychological networks in the sensitive phase of development, 
      affecting also interconnected systems. Indeed, recent discoveries show that the 
      normal overnight downscaling of slow wave activity (SWA) from the first to the last 
      hours of sleep is absent in electrical status epilepticus during sleep (ESES) 
      patients, thus impairing the neural process and possibly the local plastic changes 
      associated with learning and other cognitive functions. Moreover, specific patterns 
      of spike-induced activation (especially in perisylvian and/or prefrontal areas) and 
      deactivation of default mode network (DMN) have been shown in patients with CSWS. 
      Consequently, to date, we may conceive that the possible mechanisms underlying 
      neuropsychological disorders in encephalopathic epilepsy (EE) may be double, since 
      NREM sleep interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) induce both a pathologic 
      activation in epileptogenic areas and a pathologic deactivation of DMN beyond the 
      epileptogenic zone. The growing body of literature on the effects of ESES in CSWS 
      provides us with increasing knowledge on the complexity of brain development and a 
      better understanding of plasticity, enlightening the pathogenesis of damage on 
      developing neuropsychological functions. Finally, the need for an individually 
      tailored interpretation of the neuropsychological testing results, expected to 
      integrate neurophysiology and functional neuroimaging data, is suggested.

AB  - In many patients with major depressive disorder, sleep deprivation, or wake therapy, 
      induces an immediate but often transient antidepressant response. It is known from 
      brain imaging studies that changes in anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex activity correlate with a relief of depression symptoms. Recently, 
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that brain network 
      connectivity via the dorsal nexus (DN), a cortical area in the dorsomedial 
      prefrontal cortex, is dramatically increased in depressed patients. To investigate 
      whether an alteration in DN connectivity could provide a biomarker of therapy 
      response and to determine brain mechanisms of action underlying sleep deprivations 
      antidepressant effects, we examined its influence on resting state default mode 
      network and DN connectivity in healthy humans. Our findings show that sleep 
      deprivation reduced functional connectivity between posterior cingulate cortex and 
      bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 32), and enhanced connectivity 
      between DN and distinct areas in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 
      10). These findings are consistent with resolution of dysfunctional brain network 
      connectivity changes observed in depression and suggest changes in prefrontal 
      connectivity with the DN as a brain mechanism of antidepressant therapy action.

AB  - In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, inspiratory activation (IA) of lingual 
      muscles protects the upper airway from collapse. We aimed to determine when rats' 
      lingual muscles exhibit IA. In 5 Sprague-Dawley and 3 Wistar rats, we monitored 
      cortical EEG and lingual, diaphragmatic and nuchal electromyograms (EMGs), and 
      identified segments of records when lingual EMG exhibited IA. Individual segments 
      lasted 2.4-269 s (median: 14.5 s), most (89%) occurred during slow-wave sleep (SWS), 
      and they collectively occupied 0.3-6.1% of the total recording time. IA usually 
      started to increase with a delay after SWS onset and ended with an arousal, or 
      declined prior to rapid eye movement sleep. IA of lingual EMG was not accompanied by 
      increased diaphragmatic activity or respiratory rate changes, but occurred when 
      cortical EEG power was particularly low in a low beta-1 frequency range (12.5-16.4 
      Hz). A deep SWS-related activation of upper airway muscles may be an endogenous 
      phenomenon designed to protect the upper airway against collapse.

AB  - Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic neuropeptide present in the 
      hypothalamus of all vertebrates. MCH is implicated in a number of behaviors but 
      direct evidence is lacking. To selectively stimulate the MCH neurons the gene for 
      the light-sensitive cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2, was inserted into the MCH 
      neurons of wild-type mice. Three weeks later MCH neurons were stimulated for 1 min 
      every 5 min for 24 h. A 10 Hz stimulation at the start of the night hastened sleep 
      onset, reduced length of wake bouts by 50%, increased total time in non-REM and REM 
      sleep at night, and increased sleep intensity during the day cycle. Sleep induction 
      at a circadian time when all of the arousal neurons are active indicates that MCH 
      stimulation can powerfully counteract the combined wake-promoting signal of the 
      arousal neurons. This could be potentially useful in treatment of insomnia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on 
      sleep structure in major depression are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      the effects of prefrontal rTMS on sleep electroencephalography (EEG) in major 
      depression. METHODS: In this open-label pilot study, twelve male patients with 
      relatively mild depression, who had been medication-resistant, underwent 10 daily 
      rTMS sessions over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Polysomnographic 
      (PSG) data were recorded over four nights: Adaptation, Baseline, Post-1 (after the 
      fifth rTMS session), and Post-2 (after the tenth rTMS session). Discrete Fourier 
      Transform (DFT) band power analyses were performed to quantify delta and sigma band 
      activities during Stages II-IV, and determine time courses of these activities 
      between Baseline and Post-1 (first five sessions) and between Post-1 and Post-2 
      (last five sessions). RESULTS: Post-hoc tests based on a three-way ANOVA model 
      indicated significant delta power increase at F3 (t11 = -2.762, P = 0.018) during 
      the first five sessions; however, sigma power was unchanged. No significant band 
      power changes were observed during the second half. Stages II-IV (percent total 
      sleep time) increased significantly during the first half (t12 = -2.43, P = 0.033). 
      No other significant changes in sleep parameters or clinical correlations were 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: The first five sessions of high frequency rTMS to the left 
      DLPFC increase slow-wave activity (SWA) at F3, possibly reflecting locally enhanced 
      synaptic plasticity induced by rTMS. This increased activity was not observed during 
      the last half, possibly due to a homeostatic regulation mechanism intrinsic to SWA.

AB  - Large-scale brain functional networks (measured with functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging, fMRI) are organized into separated but interacting modules, an architecture 
      supporting the integration of distinct dynamical processes. In this work we study 
      how the aforementioned modular architecture changes with the progressive loss of 
      vigilance occurring in the descent to deep sleep and we examine the relationship 
      between the ensuing slow electroencephalographic rhythms and large-scale network 
      modularity as measured with fMRI. Graph theoretical methods are used to analyze 
      functional connectivity graphs obtained from fifty-five participants at wakefulness, 
      light and deep sleep. Network modularity (a measure of functional segregation) was 
      found to increase during deeper sleep stages but not in light sleep. By endowing 
      functional networks with dynamical properties, we found a direct link between 
      increased electroencephalographic (EEG) delta power (1-4 Hz) and a breakdown of 
      inter-modular connectivity. Both EEG slowing and increased network modularity were 
      found to quickly decrease during awakenings from deep sleep to wakefulness, in a 
      highly coordinated fashion. Studying the modular structure itself by means of a 
      permutation test, we revealed different module memberships when deep sleep was 
      compared to wakefulness. Analysis of node roles in the modular structure revealed an 
      increase in the number of locally well-connected nodes and a decrease in the number 
      of globally well-connected hubs, which hinders interactions between separated 
      functional modules. Our results reveal a well-defined sequence of changes in brain 
      modular organization occurring during the descent to sleep and establish a close 
      parallel between modularity alterations in large-scale functional networks 
      (accessible through whole brain fMRI recordings) and the slowing of scalp 
      oscillations (visible on EEG). The observed re-arrangement of connectivity might 
      play an important role in the processes underlying loss of vigilance and sensory 
      awareness during deep sleep.

AB  - The current study characterized the temporal dynamics of ocular indicators of 
      sleepiness during extended sleep restriction. Ten male participants (mean age ± SD = 
      23.3 ± 1.6 years) underwent 40 h of continuous wakefulness under constant routine 
      (CR) conditions; they completed the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and a 10-min 
      auditory psychomotor vigilance task (aPVT) hourly. Waking electroencephalography 
      (EEG) and ocular measures were recorded continuously throughout the CR. 
      Infrared-reflectance oculography was used to collect the ocular measures positive 
      and negative amplitude-velocity ratio, mean blink duration, the percentage of eye 
      closure, and a composite score of sleepiness levels (Johns Drowsiness Scale). All 
      ocular measures, except blink duration, displayed homeostatic and circadian 
      properties. Only circadian effects were detected in blink duration. Significant, 
      phase-locked cross-correlations (p < 0.05) were detected between ocular measures and 
      aPVT reaction time (RT), aPVT lapses, KSS, and EEG delta-theta (0.5-5.5 Hz), 
      theta-alpha (5.0-9.0 Hz), and beta (13.0-20.0 Hz) activity. Receiver operating 
      characteristic curve analysis demonstrated reasonable sensitivity and specificity of 
      ocular measures in correctly classifying aPVT lapses above individual baseline 
      thresholds (initial 16 h of wakefulness). Under conditions of sleep restriction, 
      ocular indicators of sleepiness paralleled performance impairment and self-rated 
      sleepiness levels, and demonstrated their potential to detect sleepiness-related 
      attentional lapses. These findings, if reproduced in a larger sample, will have 
      implications for the use of ocular-based sleepiness-warning systems in operational 
      settings.

AB  - The sleeping brain exhibits characteristic slow-wave activity which decays over the 
      course of the night. This decay is thought to result from homeostatic synaptic 
      downscaling. Transcranial electrical stimulation can entrain slow-wave oscillations 
      (SWO) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG). A computational model of the 
      underlying mechanism predicts that firing rates are predominantly increased during 
      stimulation. Assuming that synaptic homeostasis is driven by average firing rates, 
      we expected an acceleration of synaptic downscaling during stimulation, which is 
      compensated by a reduced drive after stimulation. We show that 25 minutes of 
      transcranial electrical stimulation, as predicted, reduced the decay of SWO in the 
      remainder of the night. Anatomically accurate simulations of the field intensities 
      on human cortex precisely matched the effect size in different EEG electrodes. 
      Together these results suggest a mechanistic link between electrical stimulation and 
      accelerated synaptic homeostasis in human sleep.

TI  - Disadvantageous shift in energy balance is primarily expressed in high-quality 
      sleepers after a decline in quality sleep because of disturbance.
PG  - 367-73
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.112.054924 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse or U-shaped relation between 
      sleep duration and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)). Moreover, associations between 
      energy balance (EB) and characteristics of quality sleep (QS) have recently been 
      reported. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the relation between total energy expenditure (TEE) 
      as well as substrate oxidation and QS after disturbed compared with nondisturbed 
      sleep in EB. DESIGN: Fifteen healthy men (mean ± SD BMI: 24.1 ± 1.9; age: 23.7 ± 3.5 
      y) were included in a randomized crossover study. TEE and substrate oxidation were 
      measured twice for 48 h in a respiration chamber, whereas slow-wave sleep (SWS), 
      rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep, total sleeping time (TST), sleep stage 2 (S2), and 
      QS [(SWS + REM) ÷ TST × 100%] were determined by using electroencephalography. 
      During 2 nights, sleep (2330-0730) was either disturbed or nondisturbed (control). 
      RESULTS: Positive correlations were shown for TEE, activity-induced energy 
      expenditure corrected for body mass (AEE/BM), respiratory quotient (RQ), and 
      carbohydrate oxidation with QS and SWS during nondisturbed sleep. Fat oxidation was 
      inversely correlated with QS and SWS. RQ and carbohydrate oxidation were inversely 
      related to REM sleep. During the disturbed condition SWS, REM, TST, and S2 were 
      reduced, and positive correlations were shown between TEE and AEE/BM with QS. The 
      reduction in QS was stronger in high-quality sleepers; QS reduction was positively 
      associated with increases in energy intake, TEE, and EB. CONCLUSION: A 
      disadvantageous shift in energy balance is primarily expressed in high-quality 
      sleepers after a decline in QS because of disturbance, implying that good sleepers 
      are most liable to a positive energy balance because of sleep disturbance. This 
      trial was registered at ISRCTN as NTR1919.

TI  - Do snoring sounds arouse the snorer?
PG  - 565-71
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2546 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Respiratory cycle-related electroencephalographic (EEG) changes 
      (RCREC), especially in delta and sigma frequencies, are thought to reflect subtle, 
      breath-to-breath inspiratory microarousals that are exacerbated in association with 
      increased work of breathing in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We wondered whether 
      snoring sounds could create these microarousals, and investigated whether earplugs, 
      anticipated to alter snoring perception, might affect RCREC. DESIGN: Randomized 
      controlled trial. SETTING: An accredited, academic sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: 
      Adults (n = 400) referred for suspected OSA. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomly 
      assigned to use earplugs or not during a night of diagnostic polysomnography. 
      RESULTS: Two hundred three of the participants were randomized to use earplugs. 
      Earplug use was associated with lower RCREC in delta EEG frequencies (0.5-4.5 Hz), 
      although not in other frequencies, after controlling for potential confounds (P = 
      0.048). This effect of earplug use was larger among men in comparison with women 
      (interaction term P = 0.046), and possibly among nonobese subjects in comparison 
      with obese subjects (P = 0.081). However, the effect of earplug use on delta RCREC 
      did not differ significantly based on apnea severity or snoring prominence as rated 
      by sleep technologists (P > 0.10 for each). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled 
      trial is the first study to show that perception of snoring sounds, as modulated by 
      earplugs, can influence the cortical EEG during sleep. However, the small magnitude 
      of effect, lack of effect on RCREC in EEG frequencies other than delta, and absence 
      of effect modulation by apnea severity or snoring prominence suggest that perception 
      of snoring is not the main explanation for RCREC.

TI  - A single-trial toolbox for advanced sleep polysomnographic preprocessing.
PG  - 5829-32
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610877 [doi]
AB  - The application of polysomnographic (PSG) studies for monitoring sleep activity is a 
      multi-parametric practice that involves a diverse group of biological signals. A 
      suitable preprocessing of such signals assures a more profitable feature extraction 
      and classification operations. Therefore, the proposed preprocessing toolbox 
      performs segmentation, filtering, denoising, whitening and artefact removal tasks 
      upon multi-channel PSG recordings. In order to assess toolbox's efficiency, clinical 
      experiments are conducted, as well as, quantitative and qualitative metrics are 
      discussed. Our findings reveal outperforming efficiency by artefacts and noise 
      rejection after single-trial and multi-stage preprocessing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drugs targeting insomnia ideally promote sleep throughout the night, 
      maintain normal sleep architecture, and are devoid of residual effects associated 
      with morning sedation. These features of an ideal compound are not only dependent 
      upon pharmacokinetics, receptor binding kinetics, potency and pharmacodynamic 
      activity, but also upon a compound's mechanism of action. RESULTS: Dual orexin 
      receptor antagonists (DORAs) block the arousal-promoting activity of orexin peptides 
      and, as demonstrated in the current work, exhibit an efficacy signal window 
      dependent upon oscillating levels of endogenous orexin neuropeptide. Sleep efficacy 
      of structurally diverse DORAs in rat and dog was achieved at plasma exposures 
      corresponding to orexin 2 receptor (OX2R) occupancies in the range of 65 to 80%. In 
      rats, the time course of OX2R occupancy was dependent upon receptor binding kinetics 
      and was tightly correlated with the timing of active wake reduction. In rhesus 
      monkeys, direct comparison of DORA-22 with GABA-A modulators at similar 
      sleep-inducing doses revealed that diazepam produced next-day residual sleep and 
      both diazepam and eszopiclone induced next-day cognitive deficits. In stark 
      contrast, DORA-22 did not produce residual effects. Furthermore, DORA-22 evoked only 
      minimal changes in quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) activity during the 
      normal resting phase in contrast to GABA-A modulators which induced substantial qEEG 
      changes. CONCLUSION: The higher levels of receptor occupancy necessary for DORA 
      efficacy require a plasma concentration profile sufficient to maintain sleep for the 
      duration of the resting period. DORAs, with a half-life exceeding 8 h in humans, are 
      expected to fulfill this requirement as exposures drop to sub-threshold receptor 
      occupancy levels prior to the wake period, potentially avoiding next-day residual 
      effects at therapeutic doses.

TI  - Exercise benefits for the aging brain depend on the accompanying cognitive load: 
      insights from sleep electroencephalogram.

AB  - Although exercise clearly offsets aging effects on the body, its benefits for the 
      aging brain are likely to depend on the extent that physical activity (especially 
      locomotion) facilitates multisensory encounters, curiosity, and interactions with 
      novel environments; this is especially true for exploratory activity, which occupies 
      much of wakefulness for most mammals in the wild. Cognition is inseparable from 
      physical activity, with both interlinked to promote neuroplasticity and more 
      successful brain aging. In these respects and for humans, exercising in a static, 
      featureless, artificially lit indoor setting contrasts with exploratory outdoor 
      walking within a novel environment during daylight. However, little is known about 
      the comparative benefits for the aging brain of longer-term daily regimens of this 
      latter nature including the role of sleep, to the extent that sleep enhances 
      neuroplasticity as shown in short-term laboratory studies. More discerning analyses 
      of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave activity especially 0.5-2-Hz activity 
      would provide greater insights into use-dependent recovery processes during 
      longer-term tracking of these regimens and complement slower changing waking 
      neuropsychologic and resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures, 
      including those of the brain's default mode network. Although the limited research 
      only points to ephemeral small sleep EEG effects of pure exercise, more enduring 
      effects seem apparent when physical activity incorporates cognitive challenges. In 
      terms of "use it or lose it," curiosity-driven "getting out and about," 
      encountering, interacting with, and enjoying novel situations may well provide the 
      brain with its real exercise, further reflected in changes to the dynamics of sleep.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to evaluate for the first time the hippocampal 
      changes in patients with pure sleep and pure waking epilepsy. A total of 35 patients 
      with pure partial onset sleep epilepsy and 35 patients with pure partial onset 
      waking epilepsy matched for age and sex ratio were enrolled. MR images were analyzed 
      to determine hippocampal body changes. Rounding ratio of hippocampal body was 
      defined as short axis divided by long axis and hippocampal bodies with ratios ≥ 0.70 
      were considered rounded. Hippocampal sclerosis and atrophy were found in nine (25.7 
      %) and seven (20.0 %) patients with pure sleep epilepsy, and in 12 (34.3 %) and 11 
      (31.4 %) patients with pure waking epilepsy, respectively (P > 0.05 for the 
      comparison between sleep and waking epilepsy). However, proportion of subjects with 
      rounded hippocampal bodies (15, 42.9 % vs. 3, 8.6 % for patients with sleep and 
      waking epilepsy, respectively) and rounding ratios of both left and right 
      hippocampal bodies (0.66 ± 0.13 and 0.61 ± 0.12, respectively for left and right 
      hippocampal bodies in sleep epileptic patients vs. 0.57 ± 0.11 and 0.55 ± 0.11, 
      respectively for left and right hippocampal bodies in waking epileptic patients) 
      were increased in patients with sleep epilepsy (P < 0.05). Further, in sleep 
      epileptic patients with left sided hippocampal body rounding, epileptiform 
      discharges were more readily lateralized to the left temporal lobe (P < 0.05). In 
      conclusion, hippocampal sclerosis and atrophy are not different between pure partial 
      onset sleep and waking epileptic patients. However, rounding ratio and frequency of 
      hippocampal body rounding are increased in sleep epileptic patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antibody mediated limbic encephalitis causes a sub acute encephalopathy 
      with an amnestic syndrome, seizures and often an affective prodrome. Sleep 
      disturbance including abnormal dream sleep and insomnia are described in a 
      percentage of long-term survivors but there are very few detailed assessments of 
      sleep disturbance in patients beyond the acute phase of illness. The objectives of 
      this study were to understand the causes of sleep disturbance in the long-term 
      survivors of antibody mediated limbic encephalitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We 
      screened twelve patients under long-term follow up with sleep questionnaires and 
      went on to perform detailed sleep studies (polysomnography) in those who reported 
      sleep disturbance. RESULTS: Two were found to have persistent, severe central and 
      obstructive sleep apnoea and two others to have restless legs and periodic limb 
      movements of sleep. CONCLUSIONS: This highlights the need to investigate sleep 
      disturbance in this group of patients. Effective treatments may be available to 
      improve quality of life and daytime function.

AB  - During NREM sleep cortical activity corresponding to EEG fast rhythms (FRs>10 Hz) is 
      interrupted by fragments of neural stillness (down-states), responsible for the 
      negative peak within sleep slow oscillation (SSO). Researchers still debate whether 
      the down-states spontaneously occur or need an initial overshoot in fluctuating 
      activity. Herein, we studied temporally-isolated SSO in healthy subjects in order to 
      identify two distinct EEG markers defining a putative initial up-state: i) a 
      significant positive deflection and ii) an associated FR increase, before the 
      negative peak. We found a positive bump preceding the down-state, which is 
      detectable already at the cortical SSO origin site, both during N2 and N3. This 
      early positive deflection, concurrent with a broadband activation, is characterized 
      by an increase of sigma activity (12-18 Hz) from N2 to N3, while an opposite trend 
      was observed for sigma activity crowning the up-state following the negative peak. 
      Also, we found: (i) FR activations during up-states up to high gamma frequencies; 
      (ii) depressed sigma activity in after-spindle recovery phase; and (iii) tightly 
      coordinated activities between distinct bands (12-36 Hz, ~70 Hz, ~85 Hz and 105-125 
      Hz). The correlation between different bands suggested a common mechanism for sigma 
      and gamma, and the pre-down-state activation associated with the initial bump 
      suggested an activity ignition for down-state, whose intensity is dependent on sleep 
      stage. In conclusion, we hypothesize that FR accompanying SSO could mark i) sleep 
      homeostatic processes, such as the regulation/stabilization of sleep, 
      counterbalancing the detrimental effects of continuous inputs from peripheries, and 
      ii) neural mechanisms favoring the storage of information acquired during 
      wakefulness.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the consistency and facilitating cofactors of postictal 
      generalized EEG suppression (PGES) of >20 seconds after convulsive seizures (CS), a 
      suggested predictor of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy risk. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively reviewed video-EEG data of people with ≥2 recorded CS. Presence and 
      duration of PGES were assessed by 2 independent observers blinded to patient status. 
      Intraindividual consistency of PGES >20 seconds was determined and correlations with 
      clinical characteristics were analyzed after correction for individual effects and 
      the varying number of seizures. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four seizures in 59 
      people were analyzed. PGES >20 seconds was found in 37 individuals (63%) and 57 
      (37%) of CS. The proportion of persons in whom PGES occurred consistently (presence 
      or absence of PGES >20 seconds in all CS) was lower in those with more CS. PGES of 
      >20 seconds was more frequent in seizures arising from sleep (odds ratio 3.29, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.21-8.96) and when antiepileptic medication was tapered (odds 
      ratio 4.80, 95% confidence interval 1.27-18.14). CONCLUSION: Apparent PGES 
      consistency was less frequent in people with more CS recorded, suggesting that PGES 
      is an inconsistent finding in any one individual. Thus, we believe that PGES >20 
      seconds is not a reliable predictor of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Sleep 
      and antiepileptic drug reduction appear to facilitate the occurrence of PGES.

AB  - Portable monitoring of sleep disordered breathing is the first diagnostic method not 
      only in Germany but today in other countries as well. The conditions under which 
      portable monitoring can be done with reliable results are now well defined. The 
      limitations for the use of portable monitoring are specified as well. The devices 
      used for portable monitoring are classified in four categories according to the 
      number and the kind of signals recorded. New technical developments in the field of 
      portable monitoring (polygraphy) use an indirect assessment of sleep disordered 
      breathing based on signals not directly recording respiration. The recording of ECG 
      and deriving respiration, the analysis of the plethysmographically recorded pulse 
      wave, the recording of jaw movements using magnets, and advanced analysis of 
      respiratory sounds are recent approaches. These new methods are presented with few 
      studies until now. More and larger clinical studies are needed in order to show 
      which of these systems is useful in the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing and 
      which are the specific strengths and weaknesses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of antiepileptic treatment on sleep parameters and 
      video-polysomnography (VPSG) seizures in nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE). 
      METHODS: Twenty patients with a clinical and VPSG diagnosis of NFLE (baseline 
      polysomnography [PSG]) underwent a clinical follow-up and performed a second VPSG 
      after effective antiepileptic treatment lasting for at least 6 months. Conventional 
      sleep measures, cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) parameters, and objective VPSG 
      seizures were assessed in NFLE patients before and after treatment and were compared 
      with the results of 20 age- and gender-matched control subjects. RESULTS: 
      Antiepileptic treatment determined a partial reduction of objective VPSG seizures of 
      approximately 25% compared to baseline condition. Alterations of most conventional 
      sleep measures recovered normal values, but nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep 
      instability remained pathologically enhanced (CAP rate, +26% compared to controls) 
      and was associated with persistence of daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: Residual 
      epileptic events and high levels of unstable NREM sleep can define a sort of 
      objective resistance of both seizures and disturbed arousal system to the 
      therapeutic purpose of the antiepileptic drugs in NFLE. This finding could determine 
      the need for new therapeutic options in this particular form of epilepsy.

AB  - Aging induces multiple changes to sleep spindles, which may hinder their alleged 
      functional role in memory and sleep protection mechanisms. Brain aging in specific 
      cortical regions could affect the neural networks underlying spindle generation, yet 
      the topography of these age-related changes is currently unknown. In the present 
      study, we analyzed spindle characteristics in 114 healthy volunteers aged between 20 
      and 73 years over 5 anteroposterior electroencephalography scalp derivations. 
      Spindle density, amplitude, and duration were higher in young subjects than in 
      middle-aged and elderly subjects in all derivations, but the topography of age 
      effects differed drastically. Age-related decline in density and amplitude was more 
      prominent in anterior derivations, whereas duration showed a posterior prominence. 
      Age groups did not differ in all-night spindle frequency for any derivation. These 
      results show that age-related changes in sleep spindles follow distinct 
      topographical patterns that are specific to each spindle characteristic. This 
      topographical specificity may provide a useful biomarker to localize age-sensitive 
      changes in underlying neural systems during normal and pathological aging.

TI  - Optogenetic stimulation of c1 and retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons causes sleep 
      state-dependent cardiorespiratory stimulation and arousal in rats.
PG  - 835-41
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.00860 [doi]
AB  - C1 catecholaminergic neurons and neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus are 
      integrative nodes within the brain stem network regulating cardiorespiratory 
      reflexes elicited by hypoxia and hypercapnia, stimuli that also produce arousal from 
      sleep. In the present study, Channelrhodopsin-2 was selectively introduced into 
      these neurons with a lentiviral vector to determine whether their selective 
      activation also produces arousal in sleeping rats. Sleep stages were identified from 
      electroencephalographic and neck muscle electromyographic recordings. Breathing was 
      measured using unrestrained whole body plethysmography and blood pressure by 
      telemetry. During nonrapid eye movement sleep, unilateral photostimulation of the C1 
      region caused arousal in 83.0±14.7% of trials and immediate and intense 
      cardiorespiratory activation. Arousal during photostimulation was also observed 
      during rapid eye movement sleep (41.9±5.6% of trials), but less reliably than during 
      nonrapid eye movement sleep. The cardiorespiratory responses elicited by 
      photostimulation were dramatically smaller during rapid eye movement sleep than 
      nonrapid eye movement sleep or wakefulness. Systemic α1-adrenoreceptor blockade 
      reduced the cardiorespiratory effects of photostimulation but had no effect on the 
      arousal caused by photostimulation during nonrapid eye movement sleep. Postmortem 
      histology showed that neurons expressing Channelrhodopsin 2-mCherry were 
      predominantly catecholaminergic (81%). These results show that selective activation 
      of C1 and retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons produces state-dependent arousal and 
      cardiorespiratory stimulation. These neurons, which are powerfully activated by 
      chemoreceptor stimulation, may contribute to the sleep disruption associated with 
      obstructive sleep apnea.

TI  - The effects of eszopiclone on sleep spindles and memory consolidation in 
      schizophrenia: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1369-76
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2968 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: In schizophrenia there is a dramatic reduction of sleep spindles 
      that predicts deficient sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Eszopiclone (Lunesta), 
      a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, acts on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in the 
      thalamic reticular nucleus where spindles are generated. We investigated whether 
      eszopiclone could increase spindles and thereby improve memory consolidation in 
      schizophrenia. DESIGN: In a double-blind design, patients were randomly assigned to 
      receive either placebo or 3 mg of eszopiclone. Patients completed Baseline and 
      Treatment visits, each consisting of two consecutive nights of polysomnography. On 
      the second night of each visit, patients were trained on the motor sequence task 
      (MST) at bedtime and tested the following morning. SETTING: Academic research 
      center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one chronic, medicated schizophrenia outpatients. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We compared the effects of two nights of eszopiclone vs. 
      placebo on stage 2 sleep spindles and overnight changes in MST performance. 
      Eszopiclone increased the number and density of spindles over baseline levels 
      significantly more than placebo, but did not significantly enhance overnight MST 
      improvement. In the combined eszopiclone and placebo groups, spindle number and 
      density predicted overnight MST improvement. CONCLUSION: Eszopiclone significantly 
      increased sleep spindles, which correlated with overnight motor sequence task 
      improvement. These findings provide partial support for the hypothesis that the 
      spindle deficit in schizophrenia impairs sleep-dependent memory consolidation and 
      may be ameliorated by eszopiclone. Larger samples may be needed to detect a 
      significant effect on memory. Given the general role of sleep spindles in cognition, 
      they offer a promising novel potential target for treating cognitive deficits in 
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Electroencephalogram effects of armodafinil: comparison with behavioral alertness.
PG  - 1058-71

AB  - Development of central nervous system-acting drugs would be enhanced by suitable 
      biomarkers that reflect the targeted pathophysiologic brain state. The 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) has several characteristics of an ideal biomarker and can 
      be promptly adapted to pre-clinical and clinical testing. The aim of this study was 
      to evaluate EEG as a measure of the wakefulness-promoting effect of armodafinil in 
      sleep deprived healthy subjects. Armodafinil pharmacodynamics were simultaneously 
      assessed by EEG- and behavioral-based measures including a well-established measure 
      of alertness. Using two quantitative EEG-based measures-power spectral and 
      event-related brain activity analyses-we observed that armodafinil mitigated the 
      slowing of brain activity and the decrease of the event-related brain activity 
      caused by sleep deprivation. Armodafinil-induced changes in EEG are in agreement and 
      explain up to 73.1% of the armodafinil-induced changes in alertness. Our findings 
      suggest that EEG can serve as a marker of the wakefulness-promoting drug effect.

AB  - Consistent empirical results showed that both night and day sleep enhanced memory 
      consolidation. In this study we explore processes of consolidation of memory during 
      awake hours. Since theta oscillations have been shown to play a central role in 
      exchange of information, we hypothesized that elevated theta during awake hours will 
      enhance memory consolidation. We used a neurofeedback protocol, to enhance the 
      relative power of theta or beta oscillations. Participants trained on a tapping 
      task, were divided into three groups: neurofeedback theta; neurofeedback beta; 
      control. We found a significant improvement in performance in the theta group, 
      relative to the beta and control groups, immediately after neurofeedback. 
      Performance was further improved after night sleep in all groups, with a significant 
      advantage favoring the theta group. Theta power during training was correlated with 
      the level of improvement, indicating a clear relationship between memory 
      consolidation, and theta neurofeedback.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the leg movement (LM) time structure (periodicity and night 
      distribution) during sleep in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD) and their eventual changes after treatment with levodopa (L-DOPA). SUBJECTS 
      AND METHODS: One group of ADHD patients (n=18) and another group of normal controls 
      (n=17) were recruited; those with ADHD were randomized to L-DOPA or placebo therapy. 
      At baseline (both groups) and after therapy (only patients) subjects underwent 
      full-night polysomnography (PSG) and the leg motor pattern was evaluated with 
      advanced tools of analysis particularly able to detect and describe LM time 
      structure (periodicity and distribution). RESULTS: With respect to controls ADHD 
      children showed prolonged sleep latency, increased number of stage shifts, 
      awakenings, and percentage of sleep stage 1. Arousal index was higher in ADHD and 
      also their PLMS index was slightly but considerably higher than controls; however, 
      their periodicity was low and not different from controls. Only sleep latency was 
      significantly reduced by L-DOPA treatment with all the other parameters (sleep 
      scoring and LM activity) remaining substantially unmodified. CONCLUSIONS: LMs during 
      sleep in children with ADHD do not show a highly periodic character and are not 
      considerably modified by L-DOPA treatment; this finding has potential implications 
      for drug treatment that might target the most prominent changes observed in our 
      study including arousals and sleep structure disruption.

AB  - Sleep spindles are characteristic electroencephalographic waveforms that may play 
      functionally significant roles in sleep-dependent memory consolidation, cortical 
      development, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Circumstantial evidence has connected 
      endogenous progesterone and its metabolites to the production of sleep spindles; 
      however, the effects of exogenous progestins on sleep spindles have not been 
      described in women. We examined differences in sleep spindle frequency and 
      morphology in a clinical sample of women (n=21) referred for polysomnography taking 
      depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), relative to a matched comparison group. 
      Consistent with our hypotheses, women taking MPA demonstrated significantly higher 
      sleep spindle density and maximal amplitude relative to comparison patients. Our 
      results suggest that progestins potentiate the generation of sleep spindles, which 
      may have significant implications for research that examines the role of these 
      waveforms in learning, development, and mental illness.

AB  - Over the last four decades, ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) has evolved to 
      be a useful tool in the diagnosis of epilepsy and certain nonepileptic paroxysmal 
      disorders. Most of the initial technological drawbacks of ambulatory EEG have been 
      circumvented by incorporating digital and computer technology. It appears superior 
      to routine EEG in capturing interictal abnormalities particularly in relation to 
      natural sleep, circadian variations and the patient's typical daily lifestyle. The 
      role of ambulatory EEG in studying seizures and nonepileptic paroxysmal events 
      remains to be defined by targeted research. It perhaps is an underutilized tool and 
      more research is needed to expand the horizon of ambulatory EEG applications in 
      clinical practice.

AB  - Rapid eye movements (REMs) are a prominent feature of REM sleep, and their 
      distribution and time density over the night represent important physiological and 
      clinical parameters. At the same time, REMs produce substantial distortions on the 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, which strongly affect the significance of 
      normal REM sleep quantitative study. In this work a new procedure for a complete and 
      automated analysis of REM sleep is proposed, which includes both a REMs detection 
      algorithm and an ocular artifact removal system. The two steps, based respectively 
      on Wavelet Transform and adaptive filtering, are fully integrated and their 
      performance is evaluated using REM simulated signals. Thanks to the integration with 
      the detection algorithm, the proposed artifact removal system shows an enhanced 
      accuracy in the recovering of the true EEG signal, compared to a system based on the 
      adaptive filtering only. Finally the artifact removal system is applied to 
      physiological data and an estimation of the actual distortion induced by REMs on EEG 
      signals is supplied.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the 
      basolateral amygdala (BLA) modulated sleep and fear-conditioned alterations in 
      sleep. DESIGN: After 2 days of habituation to recording procedures, baseline sleep 
      recordings were obtained. The animals were then habituated to the handling procedure 
      necessary for microinjections over 2 consecutive days. In experiment 1, rats 
      received microinjections of 0.5 μL antalarmin (1.61 or 4.82 mM), a CRF receptor 1 
      antagonist, or distilled water once a week for 3 wk. In experiment 2, rats received 
      a microinjection of either antalarmin or vehicle prior to inescapable shock training 
      (ST; 20 shocks; 0.8 mA, 0.5 sec; 1 min interstimulus interval). The animals were 
      placed back in the context 7 days later for 30 min without shock (CR; context 
      re-exposure). Sleep was recorded for 8 h after each manipulation. SETTING: NA. 
      SUBJECTS: Outbred Wistar rats. INTERVENTIONS: The rats were surgically implanted 
      with electrodes for recording the electroencephalogram and electromyogram for 
      determining arousal state and with bilateral guide cannulae directed at BLA. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Antalarmin microinjected into BLA did not significantly 
      alter sleep under undisturbed conditions. However, antalarmin microinjected 
      bilaterally into BLA prior to ST blocked reductions in rapid eye movement sleep that 
      ST normally produces. Further, the single microinjection prior to ST blocked the 
      reduction in rapid eye movement typically seen after subsequent CR. Behavioral 
      freezing, an indicator of fear memory, was not altered. CONCLUSIONS: CRF in BLA is 
      involved in regulating stress-induced alterations in sleep and it plays a role in 
      modulating how stressful memories influence sleep.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the maturation of sleep wake cycling (SWC) in premature infants 
      has been described, its value in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome (NDO) is yet 
      to be known. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between NDO and SWC evaluated by 
      amplitude integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) in very low birth weight (VLBW) 
      infants. STUDY DESIGN: VLBW infants (<1500 grams and ≤34 weeks gestational age) were 
      enrolled in a prospective study. Two channel 12-hour aEEG recordings were completed 
      at 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) and SWC scores were assigned. NDO was measured 
      by the Bayley's Mental Developmental Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Developmental Index 
      (PDI) at 9 and 18 months corrected age (CA). RESULTS: Eighty-four of the 103 
      enrolled infants had an aEEG completed at 34 weeks PMA. At 9 months CA, in linear 
      regression models, MDI was significantly associated with severe intraventricular 
      hemorrhage (IVH) and SWC score, while PDI was associated with GA and SWC score. At 
      18 months CA, these associations lost significance. CONCLUSIONS: At 34 weeks PMA, 
      all VLBW premature infants demonstrate some degree of SWC on aEEG. Maturation of SWC 
      at 34 weeks PMA is not associated with gestational age, however may relate to early 
      NDO. Further studies are needed to evaluate this relationship.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sleepwalkers often complain of excessive daytime somnolence (EDS). Our 
      retrospective study aimed to document the presence of EDS in a substantial sample of 
      sleepwalkers and to explore the contribution of other sleep disorders, nocturnal 
      sleep disruption, and sleep depth to the alteration of their daytime vigilance. 
      METHODS: Seventy adult sleepwalkers and 70 control subjects completed the Epworth 
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Sleepwalkers also were studied for one night in the sleep 
      laboratory. We compared the sleep profiles of 32 somnolent vs 38 nonsomnolent 
      sleepwalkers and investigated the relationship between ESS scores and sleep-related 
      variables. RESULTS: No differences were found in polysomnographic (PSG) parameters. 
      Slow-wave activity (SWA) also was similar in the two subgroups. Sleepwalkers' ESS 
      scores were not correlated with their body mass index (BMI) or periodic limb 
      movements during sleep (PLMS) index, but they tended to be negatively correlated 
      with indices of respiratory events. CONCLUSIONS: The EDS reported by adult 
      sleepwalkers does not appear to be explained by the presence of concomitant sleep 
      disorders or PSG signs of nocturnal sleep disruption. These results raise the 
      possibility that EDS is part of the sleepwalking phenotype and that it is linked to 
      its underlying pathophysiology.

TI  - Clinical evolution of seizures: distribution across time of day and 
      sleep/wakefulness cycle.
PG  - 549-57
LID - 10.1007/s00415-012-6675-3 [doi]
AB  - Seizures can evolve sequentially into different clinical phases. For example, a 
      seizure may start as an aura (first phase), then evolve into a tonic seizure (second 
      phase), and evolve further into a generalized tonic-clonic semiology (third phase). 
      It is currently unknown whether specific seizure evolutions cluster at particular 
      times of the day and/or during sleep/wakefulness. We aimed to describe the 
      distribution of the clinical evolution of seizures across time of day and sleep/wake 
      state. We included all patients with at least two seizure phases admitted for 
      long-term electroencephalogram monitoring during a 5 year period. 
      Two-hundred-and-fifteen patients (866 seizures) presented with two different phases 
      and 87 patients (324 seizures) evolved into a third clinical phase. During phase 
      two, evolution into clonic seizures differed across time (p = 0.047) with peaks at 
      0-3 h and 6-9 h and during sleep (p < 0.001), evolution into automotor seizures 
      peaked during wakefulness (p = 0.015), evolution into tonic seizures differed across 
      time (p = 0.005) with peaks at 21-12 h and during sleep (p = 0.0119), and 
      generalized tonic-clonic seizures peaked during sleep (p = 0.0067). Findings 
      remained statistically significant after multivariable analysis adjusting, 
      separately, for potential confounders (semiology of the first phase, age, gender, 
      days in the long-term electroencephalographic monitoring unit, abnormal 
      neuroimaging, number of antiepileptic medications, and seizure localization). During 
      phase three, seizure evolutions followed the same pattern of distribution as during 
      phase two but differences did not reach statistical significance. Our data 
      demonstrate that the evolution of seizures into different phases cluster at specific 
      times of day and at specific phases of the sleep/wakefulness cycle.

AB  - A design for a modular, compact, and accurate wireless electroencephalograph (EEG) 
      system is proposed. EEG is the only non-invasive measure for neuronal function of 
      the brain. Using a number of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques, this 
      neuronal function can be acquired and processed into meaningful representations of 
      brain activity. The system described here utilizes Bluetooth to wirelessly transmit 
      the digitized brain signal for an end application use. In this way, the system is 
      portable, and modular in terms of the device to which it can interface. Brain 
      Computer Interface (BCI) has become a popular extension of EEG systems in modern 
      research. This design serves as a platform for applications using BCI capability.

PG  - 4977-80
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610665 [doi]
AB  - Drowsiness is one of the major risk factors causing accidents that result in a large 
      number of damage. Drivers and industrial workers probably have a large effect on 
      several mishaps occurring from drowsiness. Therefore, advanced technology to reduce 
      these accidental rates is a very challenging problem. Nowadays, there have been many 
      drowsiness detectors using electroencephalogram (EEG), however, the cost is still 
      high and the use of this is uncomfortable in long-term monitoring because most of 
      them require wiring and conventional wet electrodes. The purpose of this paper is to 
      develop a portable wireless device that can automatically detect the drowsiness in 
      real time by using the EEG and electrooculogram (EOG). The silver (Ag) conducting 
      fabric consolidated in a headband used as dry electrodes can acquire signal from the 
      user's forehead. The signal was sent via the wireless communication of XBee® 
      802.15.4 to a standalone microcontroller to analyze drowsiness using the proposed 
      algorithm. The alarm will ring when the drowsiness occurs. Besides, the automatic 
      drowsiness detection and alarm device yields the real-time detection accuracy of 
      approximately 81%.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies in young healthy volunteers provided evidence of a beneficial 
      impact of an anodal time-varied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) 
      during early slow wave rich sleep on declarative memory but not on procedural 
      memory. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The present study investigated whether sleep-dependent 
      memory consolidation can also be affected by slow oscillating tDCS in a population 
      of elderly subjects. METHODS: 26 subjects (69.1 years ± 7.7 years) received 
      bi-frontal anodal stimulation (max. current density: 0.331 mA/cm(2)) during early 
      NREM sleep in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover study. 
      Stimulation effects on offline consolidation were tested by using a declarative and 
      a procedural memory task. Furthermore, sleep stages were scored, EEG power was 
      analyzed and spindle densities were assessed. RESULTS: Independently from 
      stimulation condition, performance in both memory tasks significantly decreased 
      overnight. Stimulation revealed no significant effect on sleep-dependent memory 
      consolidation. Verum tDCS was accompanied by significantly more time awake and 
      significantly less NREM stage 3 sleep during five 1-min stimulation free intervals. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study are in line with other studies showing 
      that offline consolidation during sleep varies with age and is less pronounced in 
      the elderly than in young or middle-aged subjects. Contrary to an almost identical 
      positive study in young adults, slow oscillatory tDCS applied to the elderly failed 
      to show a beneficial effect on memory consolidation in the present study.

TI  - Atypical sleep in ventilated patients: empirical electroencephalography findings and

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Standard sleep scoring criteria may be unreliable when applied to 
      critically ill patients. We sought to quantify typical and atypical polysomnographic 
      findings in critically ill patients and to begin development and reliability testing 
      of methodology to characterize the atypical polysomnographic tracings that confound 
      standard sleep scoring criteria. DESIGN: Prospective convenience sample. SETTING: 
      Two academic, tertiary care medical centers. PATIENTS: Thirty-seven critically ill, 
      mechanically ventilated, medical ICU patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      MAIN RESULTS: Mechanically ventilated subjects were monitored by continuous 
      polysomnography. After noting frequent atypical polysomnographic findings (i.e., 
      lack of stage N2 markers, the presence of polymorphic delta, burst suppression, or 
      isoelectric electroencephalography), attempts to use standard sleep scoring criteria 
      alone were abandoned. Atypical polysomnographic findings were characterized and used 
      to develop a modified scoring system. Polysomnographic data were scored manually via 
      this revised scoring scheme. Of 37 medical ICU patients enrolled, 36 experienced 
      atypical sleep, which accounted for 85% of all recorded data, with 5.1% normal sleep 
      and 9.4% wake. Coupling observed patient arousal levels with polysomnographic 
      characteristics revealed that standard polysomnographic staging criteria did not 
      reliably determine the presence or absence of sleep. Rapid eye movement occurred in 
      only five patients (14%). The revised scoring system incorporating frequently seen 
      atypical characteristics yielded very high interrater reliability (weighted κ = 
      0.80; bootstrapped 95% CI, [0.48, 0.89]). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of polysomnographic 
      data revealed profound deficiencies in standard scoring criteria due to a 
      predominance of atypical polysomnographic findings in ventilated patients. The 
      revised scoring scheme proved reliable in sleep staging and may serve as a building 
      block in future work.

TI  - Quantitative electroencephalography during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM 
      sleep in combat-exposed veterans with and without post-traumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 76-82
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2869.2012.01040.x [doi]
AB  - Sleep disturbances are a hallmark feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
      and associated with poor clinical outcomes. Few studies have examined sleep 
      quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), a technique able to detect subtle 
      differences that polysomnography does not capture. We hypothesized that greater 
      high-frequency qEEG would reflect 'hyperarousal' in combat veterans with PTSD 
      (n = 16) compared to veterans without PTSD (n = 13). EEG power in traditional EEG 
      frequency bands was computed for artifact-free sleep epochs across an entire night. 
      Correlations were performed between qEEG and ratings of PTSD symptoms and combat 
      exposure. The groups did not differ significantly in whole-night qEEG measures for 
      either rapid eye movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep. Non-significant medium 
      effect sizes suggest less REM beta (opposite to our hypothesis), less REM and NREM 
      sigma and more NREM gamma in combat veterans with PTSD. Positive correlations were 
      found between combat exposure and NREM beta (PTSD group only), and REM and NREM 
      sigma (non-PTSD group only). Results did not support global hyperarousal in PTSD as 
      indexed by increased beta qEEG activity. The correlation of sigma activity with 
      combat exposure in those without PTSD and the non-significant trend towards less 
      sigma activity during both REM and NREM sleep in combat veterans with PTSD suggests 
      that differential information processing during sleep may characterize 
      combat-exposed military veterans with and without PTSD.

TI  - Slow wave activity and slow oscillations in sleepwalkers and controls: effects of 
      38 h of sleep deprivation.
PG  - 430-3
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12041 [doi]
AB  - Sleepwalkers have been shown to have an unusually high number of arousals from slow 
      wave sleep and lower slow wave activity (SWA) power during the night than controls. 
      Because sleep deprivation increases the frequency of slow wave sleep (SWS) arousals 
      in sleepwalkers, it may also affect the expression of the homeostatic process to a 
      greater extent than shown previously. We thus investigated SWA power as well as slow 
      wave oscillation (SWO) density in 10 sleepwalkers and nine controls at baseline and 
      following 38 h of sleep deprivation. There was a significant increase in SWA during 
      participants' recovery sleep, especially during their second non-rapid eye movement 
      (NREM) period. SWO density was similarly increased during recovery sleep's first two 
      NREM periods. A fronto-central gradient in SWA and SWO was also present on both 
      nights. However, no group differences were noted on any of the 2 nights on SWA or 
      SWO. This unexpected result may be related to the heterogeneity of sleepwalkers as a 
      population, as well as our small sample size. SWA pressure after extended sleep 
      deprivation may also result in a ceiling effect in both sleepwalkers and controls.

AB  - Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with the occurrence of seizures, which are often 
      accompanied by sleep. Prostaglandin (PG) D2 is produced by hematopoietic or 
      lipocalin-type PGD synthase (H- or L-PGDS) and involved in the regulation of 
      physiological sleep. Here, we show that H-PGDS, L/H-PGDS or DP1 receptor (DP1R) KO 
      mice exhibited more intense pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in terms of 
      latency of seizure onset, duration of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and number 
      of seizure spikes. Seizures significantly increased the PGD2 content of the brain in 
      wild-type mice. This PTZ-induced increase in PGD2 was attenuated in the brains of L- 
      or H-PGDS KO and abolished in L/H-PGDS KO mice. Postictal non-rapid eye movement 
      sleep was observed in the wild-type and H-PGDS or DP2R KO, but not in the L-, 
      L/H-PGDS or DP1R KO, mice. These findings demonstrate that PGD2 produced by H-PGDS 
      and acting on DP1R is essential for seizure suppression and that the 
      L-PGDS/PGD2/DP1R system regulates sleep that follows seizures.

TI  - The role of sleep spindles and slow-wave activity in integrating new information in 
      semantic memory.

AB  - Assimilating new information into existing knowledge is a fundamental part of 
      consolidating new memories and allowing them to guide behavior optimally and is 
      vital for conceptual knowledge (semantic memory), which is accrued over many years. 
      Sleep is important for memory consolidation, but its impact upon assimilation of new 
      information into existing semantic knowledge has received minimal examination. Here, 
      we examined the integration process by training human participants on novel words 
      with meanings that fell into densely or sparsely populated areas of semantic memory 
      in two separate sessions. Overnight sleep was polysomnographically monitored after 
      each training session and recall was tested immediately after training, after a 
      night of sleep, and 1 week later. Results showed that participants learned equal 
      numbers of both word types, thus equating amount and difficulty of learning across 
      the conditions. Measures of word recognition speed showed a disadvantage for novel 
      words in dense semantic neighborhoods, presumably due to interference from many 
      semantically related concepts, suggesting that the novel words had been successfully 
      integrated into semantic memory. Most critically, semantic neighborhood density 
      influenced sleep architecture, with participants exhibiting more sleep spindles and 
      slow-wave activity after learning the sparse compared with the dense neighborhood 
      words. These findings provide the first evidence that spindles and slow-wave 
      activity mediate integration of new information into existing semantic networks.

TI  - Sleep spindles are generated in the absence of T-type calcium channel-mediated 
      low-threshold burst firing of thalamocortical neurons.
PG  - 20266-71
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1320572110 [doi]
AB  - T-type Ca(2+) channels in thalamocortical (TC) neurons have long been considered to 
      play a critical role in the genesis of sleep spindles, one of several TC 
      oscillations. A classical model for TC oscillations states that reciprocal 
      interaction between synaptically connected GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus 
      (TRN) neurons and glutamatergic TC neurons generates oscillations through T-type 
      channel-mediated low-threshold burst firings of neurons in the two nuclei. These 
      oscillations are then transmitted from TC neurons to cortical neurons, contributing 
      to the network of TC oscillations. Unexpectedly, however, we found that both WT and 
      KO mice for CaV3.1, the gene for T-type Ca(2+) channels in TC neurons, exhibit 
      typical waxing-and-waning sleep spindle waves at a similar occurrence and with 
      similar amplitudes and episode durations during non-rapid eye movement sleep. 
      Single-unit recording in parallel with electroencephalography in vivo confirmed a 
      complete lack of burst firing in the mutant TC neurons. Of particular interest, the 
      tonic spike frequency in TC neurons was significantly increased during spindle 
      periods compared with nonspindle periods in both genotypes. In contrast, no 
      significant change in burst firing frequency between spindle and nonspindle periods 
      was noted in the WT mice. Furthermore, spindle-like oscillations were readily 
      generated within intrathalamic circuits composed solely of TRN and TC neurons in 
      vitro in both the KO mutant and WT mice. Our findings call into question the 
      essential role of low-threshold burst firings in TC neurons and suggest that tonic 
      firing is important for the generation and propagation of spindle oscillations in 
      the TC circuit.

TI  - Encephalopathy with hemi-status epilepticus during sleep or hemi-continuous spikes

AB  - PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyze the electroclinical features, etiology, 
      treatment, and prognosis of 21 patients with encephalopathy with hemi-status 
      epilepticus during sleep (ESES) or hemi-continuous spikes and waves during slow 
      sleep (CSWSS) syndrome. METHODS: Charts of 21 patients with hemi-ESES/CSWSS syndrome 
      followed between 1997 and 2012 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were: (1) Focal 
      seizures or apparently generalized seizures and focal EEG epileptiform discharges; 
      (2) Further occurrence of atypical absences, and myoclonic, atonic, and/or 
      generalized seizures; (3) Cognitive impairment and/or behavioral disturbances; (4) 
      Hemi-continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep in more than 85% of 
      non-REM sleep at onset and throughout the ESES/CSWSS period. RESULTS: Mean follow-up 
      from onset of hemi-ESES/CSWSS was 8 years (range, 2-15 years). Idiopathic cases were 
      not identified. Unilateral polymicrogyria was found in 11, shunted hydrocephalus in 
      four, a porencephalic cyst associated with polymicrogyria in three, and a thalamic 
      lesion in three children. All started with focal seizures with or without secondary 
      generalization. During the hemi-ESES/CSWSS period, all children developed new types 
      of seizure, such as negative and positive myoclonus, absences, motor deterioration, 
      cognitive impairment, and behavioral disturbances. All AED responders returned to 
      baseline cognitive development. Seven patients were refractory to AEDs. CONCLUSION: 
      Our study suggests that the hemi-ESES/CSWSS syndrome has electroclinical features 
      compatible with an epileptic encephalopathy. The most commonly used treatments were 
      clobazam, ethosuximide, and sulthiame, alone or in combination. In refractory cases, 
      high-dose corticosteroids were administered. Although the number of patients in this 
      study is too low to draw definite conclusions, we consider that in children with 
      hemi-ESES/CSWSS secondary to a unilateral lesion, surgery should be considered.

AB  - A bulk of studies in rodents and humans suggest that sleep facilitates different 
      phases of learning and memory process, while sleep deprivation (SD) impairs these 
      processes. Here we tested the hypothesis that SD could alter spatial learning and 
      memory processing in a non-human primate, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), 
      which is an interesting model of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two sets of 
      experiments were performed. In a first set of experiments, we investigated the 
      effects of SD on spatial learning and memory retrieval after one day of training in 
      a circular platform task. Eleven male mouse lemurs aged between 2 to 3 years were 
      tested in three different conditions: without SD as a baseline reference, 8 h of SD 
      before the training and 8 h of SD before the testing. The SD was confirmed by 
      electroencephalographic recordings. Results showed no effect of SD on learning when 
      SD was applied before the training. When the SD was applied before the testing, it 
      induced an increase of the amount of errors and of the latency prior to reach the 
      target. In a second set of experiments, we tested the effect of 8 h of SD on spatial 
      memory retrieval after 3 days of training. Twenty male mouse lemurs aged between 2 
      to 3 years were tested in this set of experiments. In this condition, the SD did not 
      affect memory retrieval. This is the first study that documents the disruptive 
      effects of the SD on spatial memory retrieval in this primate which may serve as a 
      new validated challenge to investigate the effects of new compounds along 
      physiological and pathological aging.

PG  - 7590-607
LID - 10.1021/jm4007627 [doi]
AB  - Dual orexin receptor (OXR) antagonists (DORAs) such as almorexant, 1 (SB-649868), or 
      suvorexant have shown promise for the treatment of insomnias and sleep disorders in 
      several recent clinical trials in volunteers and primary insomnia patients. The 
      relative contribution of antagonism of OX1R and OX2R for sleep induction is still a 
      matter of debate. We therefore initiated a drug discovery project with the aim of 
      creating both OX2R selective antagonists and DORAs. Here we report that the OX2R 
      selective antagonist 26 induced sleep in mice primarily by increasing NREM sleep, 
      whereas the DORA suvorexant induced sleep largely by increasing REM sleep. Thus, 
      OX2R selective antagonists may also be beneficial for the treatment of insomnia.

TI  - Impact of GH replacement therapy on sleep in adult patients with GH deficiency of 
      pituitary origin.
PG  - 763-70
LID - 10.1530/EJE-12-1037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We previously reported that adult patients with GH deficiency (GHD) due 
      to a confirmed or likely pituitary defect, compared with healthy controls 
      individually matched for age, gender, and BMI, have more slow-wave sleep (SWS) and 
      higher delta activity (a marker of SWS intensity). Here, we examined the impact of 
      recombinant human GH (rhGH) therapy, compared with placebo, on objective sleep 
      quality in a subset of patients from the same cohort. DESIGN: Single-blind, 
      randomized, crossover design study. METHODS: Fourteen patients with untreated GHD of 
      confirmed or likely pituitary origin, aged 22-74 years, participated in the study. 
      Patients with associated hormonal deficiencies were on appropriate replacement 
      therapy. Polygraphic sleep recordings, with bedtimes individually tailored to 
      habitual sleep times, were performed after 4 months on rhGH or placebo. RESULTS: 
      Valid data were obtained in 13 patients. At the end of the rhGH treatment period, 
      patients had a shorter sleep period time than at the end of the placebo period 
      (479±11 vs 431±19 min respectively; P=0.005), primarily due to an earlier wake-up 
      time, and a decrease in the intensity of SWS (delta activity) (559±125 vs 794±219 
      μV(2) respectively; P=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Four months of rhGH replacement therapy 
      partly reversed sleep disturbances previously observed in untreated patients. The 
      decrease in delta activity associated with rhGH treatment adds further evidence to 
      the hypothesis that the excess of high-intensity SWS observed in untreated pituitary 
      GHD patients is likely to result from overactivity of the hypothalamic GHRH system 
      due to the lack of negative feedback inhibition by GH.

TI  - Encephalopathy with status epilepticus during sleep or continuous spikes and waves 
      during slow sleep syndrome: a multicenter, long-term follow-up study of 117 
      patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyze the electroclinical features, etiology, 
      treatment and prognosis of 117 patients with encephalopathy with status epilepticus 
      during sleep (ESES) or continuous spike and waves slow sleep (CSWSS) syndrome with a 
      long-term follow-up. METHODS: Charts of 117 patients with ESES/CSWSS syndrome 
      followed between 1990 and 2012 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were: (1) focal 
      seizures or apparently generalized seizures and focal EEG epileptiform discharges; 
      (2) further occurrence of atypical absences, and myoclonic, atonic, and/or 
      generalized seizures; (3) cognitive impairment and/or behavior disturbances; (4) 
      continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep in more than 85% of non-REM 
      sleep. Patients with spike-and-wave discharges in less than 85% of slow sleep were 
      also analyzed. KEY FINDINGS: 'Mean follow-up from onset of ESES/CSWSS was 13 years 
      (range, 2-22 years) in the symptomatic/structural and non-idiopathic group 
      consisting of 79 children and 10.5 years (range, 2-21 years) in the idiopathic group 
      consisting of 38 children. The comparison of clinical findings and localization of 
      paroxysmal EEG abnormalities (focal, multifocal, or generalized) at the different 
      stages (before, during, and after ESES/CSWSS) and the percentage of spike-wave index 
      during ESES/CSWSS between the symptomatic/structural and non-idiopathic and the 
      idiopathic group was not statistically significant. SIGNIFICANCE: ESES/CSWSS 
      syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy with similar electroclinical findings in 
      children with a >85% spike-wave index and those with a <85% spike-wave index. In 
      this series of patients, the most commonly used treatments were clobazam, 
      ethosuximide, sulthiame, alone or in combination. In refractory cases, high-dose 
      steroids were administered. Among the AED responders, the idiopathic cases returned 
      to normality and the structural cases returned to baseline cognitive development.

LID - 10.1007/s00221-013-3781-0 [doi]
AB  - The relationship between emotional or neutral declarative memory consolidation and 
      sleep architecture was investigated. Thirty university students (21 females) viewed 
      negative, neutral, or positive pictures and rated their valence and arousal in the 
      evening. Participants performed a recognition test 1 h later and then underwent 
      overnight polysomnography. Their post-encoding sleep architecture was compared to a 
      baseline night. Participants returned 6 days following encoding for a second 
      recognition test. Results showed no group (Negative, Neutral, Positive) differences 
      in recognition 1 h or 6 days following encoding. Stage 2 sleep spindle density 
      decreased across all groups following encoding, and recognition after 6 days was 
      positively correlated with Stage 2 sleep spindle density on both nights. There was 
      no change in REM density in any of the groups. This is the first investigation into 
      phasic sleep microarchitecture changes following emotional and neutral declarative 
      learning. Future investigations may benefit from more salient emotional stimuli.

TI  - Spindle power is not affected after spontaneous K-complexes during human NREM sleep.
PG  - e54343

LID - e54343
AB  - K-complexes and sleep spindles often grouped together characterize the second stage 
      of NREM sleep and interest has been raised on a possible interaction of their 
      underlying mechanisms. The reported inhibition of spindles power for about 15 
      seconds following evoked K-complexes has implications on their role in arousal. Our 
      objective was to assess this inhibition following spontaneous K-complexes. We used 
      time-frequency analysis of spontaneous K-complexes selected from whole-night EEG 
      recordings of normal subjects. Our results show that spindles are most often 
      observed at the positive phase following the peak of a spontaneous KC (70%). At 
      latencies of 1-3 s following the peak of the K-complex, spindles almost disappear. 
      Compared to long-term effects described for evoked KCs, sleep spindle power is not 
      affected by spontaneous KCs for latencies of 5-15 s. Observation of the recurrence 
      rate of sporadic spindles suggests that the reduction of power at 1-3 s most likely 
      reflects a refractory period of spindles lasting for 1-2 s, rather than an effect of 
      KCs. These results suggest that the mechanisms underlying spontaneous KCs do not 
      affect spindle power as in the case of evoked KCs.

TI  - Examining factors related to accelerated long-term forgetting in epilepsy using 
      ambulatory EEG monitoring.
PG  - 819-27
LID - 10.1111/epi.12090 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Some patients with epilepsy demonstrate normal memory when this is tested 
      at relatively short intervals (e.g., 30 min), but substantial loss over longer delay 
      periods (e.g., days or weeks) when compared to healthy control subjects. This 
      pattern of "accelerated long-term forgetting" (ALF) affects the everyday lives of 
      patients, yet goes undetected by standard neuropsychological memory tests, and its 
      pathophysiologic basis is poorly understood. By testing memory over a period of 
      concurrent ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG), the current study aimed to 
      investigate possible factors contributing to ALF. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients 
      diagnosed with epilepsy or probable epilepsy underwent 5 days of continuous 
      ambulatory EEG: 18 had normal EEG studies, 10 had focal epileptic discharges, 5 had 
      generalized epileptic discharges, and 6 had one or more seizures. Fifteen matched 
      healthy control subjects also participated, but did not undergo EEG. Subjects were 
      taught 13-item word and design lists to criterion, and recall was tested at 30 min, 
      24 h, and 4 days. Subjects also completed questionnaires pertaining to everyday 
      memory and mood. KEY FINDINGS: Group analyses (excluding patients who experienced 
      seizures during monitoring) indicated that patients who experienced generalized 
      discharges during the 24-h to 4-day delay intervals showed higher rates of 
      forgetting for nonverbal information. Those with focal discharges showed ALF between 
      30 min and 4 days for verbal information, whereas those with normal EEGs over the 4 
      days recording had no evidence of ALF. Surprisingly, mood and epilepsy variables 
      (such as duration of disease or number of anticonvulsant medications) showed no 
      significant correlation with ALF. Although no aspect of nighttime sleep architecture 
      was found to be related to recall after the first 24 h, daytime naps were associated 
      with better retention. Self-report of everyday memory functioning was related to 
      recall at longer delays, but not at 30 min. SIGNIFICANCE: The present findings 
      indicated that ALF in epilepsy is associated with subclinical discharges rather than 
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), mood or sleep disturbance. Measures of longer-term 
      recall can reveal correlations with subjective everyday memory complaints that are 
      not evident when recall is only tested at a standard (30 min) delay interval. These 
      findings have the potential to improve treatment strategies for patients who 
      complain of memory difficulties.

TI  - Enhanced spontaneous oscillations in the supplementary motor area are associated 
      with sleep-dependent offline learning of finger-tapping motor-sequence task.
PG  - 13894-902
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1198-13.2013 [doi]
AB  - Sleep is beneficial for various types of learning and memory, including a 
      finger-tapping motor-sequence task. However, methodological issues hinder 
      clarification of the crucial cortical regions for sleep-dependent consolidation in 
      motor-sequence learning. Here, to investigate the core cortical region for 
      sleep-dependent consolidation of finger-tapping motor-sequence learning, while human 
      subjects were asleep, we measured spontaneous cortical oscillations by 
      magnetoencephalography together with polysomnography, and source-localized the 
      origins of oscillations using individual anatomical brain information from MRI. 
      First, we confirmed that performance of the task at a retest session after sleep 
      significantly increased compared with performance at the training session before 
      sleep. Second, spontaneous δ and fast-σ oscillations significantly increased in the 
      supplementary motor area (SMA) during post-training compared with pretraining sleep, 
      showing significant and high correlation with the performance increase. Third, the 
      increased spontaneous oscillations in the SMA correlated with performance 
      improvement were specific to slow-wave sleep. We also found that correlations of δ 
      oscillation between the SMA and the prefrontal and between the SMA and the parietal 
      regions tended to decrease after training. These results suggest that a core brain 
      region for sleep-dependent consolidation of the finger-tapping motor-sequence 
      learning resides in the SMA contralateral to the trained hand and is mediated by 
      spontaneous δ and fast-σ oscillations, especially during slow-wave sleep. The 
      consolidation may arise along with possible reorganization of a larger-scale 
      cortical network that involves the SMA and cortical regions outside the motor 
      regions, including prefrontal and parietal regions.

AB  - This study presents data on some phasic EEG phenomena regulary recorded during sleep 
      - wakefulness cycle and heterogeneity of EEG sleep stages forming consecutive human 
      sleep macrocycles. These short-term EEG changes quite often tend to periodization, 
      especially during initial sleep-stages and transitive states (sleep microcycles). An 
      attempt was made to reveal EEG microstructures in sleep - wakefulness cycle on the 
      basis of 7 clusters reflecting changes in the biopotential field of the brain 
      represented in n-dimensional factorial space. It was found that most sleep stages 
      were presented by 3-4 clusters, but some sleep periods (such as B (Loomis, 1937) and 
      IREM) showed more homogeneous structure. It was suggested that the heterogeneity of 
      the EEG spatial organization within sleep stages reflect the dynamics of 
      neurophysiological processes underlying reparative and homeostatic sleep functions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In recent years there has been growing interest in the use of 
      pupillography as an objective and time-saving method to assess the level of 
      sleepiness. The aim of our study was to further elucidate the validity of 
      pupillography by investigating the association of pupillometric variables with 
      subjective sleepiness and waking electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. METHODS: The 
      level of sleepiness of 24 young healthy adults was evaluated during 40h of sustained 
      wakefulness using pupillography and subjective ratings with the Stanford sleepiness 
      scale and a visual analog scale (VAS). During the assessment of sleepiness by 
      pupillography, waking EEG was simultaneously recorded and subjected to spectral 
      analyses. As a pupillographic measure of sleepiness the pupillary unrest index (PUI) 
      was calculated. RESULTS: PUI, subjective sleepiness, and power in the δ, θ, α1, β1, 
      and β3 frequency band exhibited significant variations over time. PUI showed a 
      prominent circadian modulation under high homeostatic sleep pressure. At time points 
      of maximum PUI indicating a high level of sleepiness, significant increases were 
      found in subjective sleepiness as well as in δ, θ, α1, and β1 power. Moreover, PUI 
      showed a significant, high intraindividual correlation with subjective sleepiness 
      and with power in the δ, θ, and α1 frequency band. CONCLUSION: The novel finding of 
      a close association between pupillometric variables and distinct changes in waking 
      EEG activity underscores the validity of pupillography as a time- and cost-efficient 
      objective measure of sleepiness that could ease the diagnostic and therapeutic 
      workup of patients who report excessive daytime sleepiness.

AB  - The developmental origins of sleep and brain activity rhythms in higher vertebrate 
      animals (birds and mammals) are currently unknown. In order to create an 
      experimental system in which these could be better elucidated, we designed, built 
      and tested a system for recording EEG and EMG signals in-ovo from chicken embryos 
      incubated for 16-21 days. This system can remain attached to the individual subject 
      through the process of hatching and continue to be worn post-natally. Electrode 
      wires surgically implanted on the head of the embryo are connected to a 
      battery-operated ultraportable transmitter which can either be attached to the 
      eggshell or worn on the back. The transmitter processes up to 6 channels of data 
      with a maximum sampling frequency of 500 Hz and a resolution of 12 bits. The radio 
      link uses a carrier frequency of 4 MHz, and has a maximum transfer rate of 500 
      kbit/s; receiving antennas compatible with both in-egg recordings and post-natal 
      recordings from freely-moving birds were produced. A receiver connected with one USB 
      port of a PC transmits the data for digital storage. This system is based on 
      discrete, off-the-shelf components, can provide a few days of continuous operation 
      with a single lithium coin battery, and has a noise floor level of 0.35 μV. The 
      transmitter dimensions are 16 × 13 × 1.5 mm and the weight without the battery is 
      0.7 g. The microprocessor allows flexible operation modes not usually made available 
      in other small multichannel acquisition systems implemented by means of ad hoc mixed 
      signal chips.

TI  - Increases in cAMP, MAPK activity, and CREB phosphorylation during REM sleep: 
      implications for REM sleep and memory consolidation.
PG  - 6460-8
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5018-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), 
      and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcriptional pathway is required 
      for consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory. In mice, this pathway undergoes a 
      circadian oscillation required for memory persistence that reaches a peak during the 
      daytime. Because mice exhibit polyphasic sleep patterns during the day, this 
      suggested the interesting possibility that cAMP, MAPK activity, and CREB 
      phosphorylation may be elevated during sleep. Here, we report that cAMP, 
      phospho-p44/42 MAPK, and phospho-CREB are higher in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 
      compared with awake mice but are not elevated in non-REM sleep. This peak of 
      activity during REM sleep does not occur in mice lacking calmodulin-stimulated 
      adenylyl cyclases, a mouse strain that learns but cannot consolidate 
      hippocampus-dependent memory. We conclude that a preferential increase in cAMP, MAPK 
      activity, and CREB phosphorylation during REM sleep may contribute to 
      hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation.

      diurnal rhythm of sleep and wakefulness.
PG  - 1391-404
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2972 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Serotonergic (5HT) neurons of the dorsal raphe nuclei receive 
      excitatory input from hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) neurons and reciprocally 
      inhibit orexin neurons through the 5HT1A receptor. However, the physiological 
      significance of this negative feedback circuit for sleep/wakefulness regulation is 
      little understood. DESIGN: 5HT1A receptor expression level was specifically and 
      reversibly controlled in the orexin neurons using the Tet-off system. The 
      responsiveness of orexin neurons to 5HT in vitro and the sleep/wakefulness patterns 
      were compared between 5HT1A-overexpressing and control mice. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      RESULTS: When the 5HT1A receptor was overexpressed in orexin neurons of Orexin-EGFP; 
      orexin-tTA; TetO Htr1a mice, 5HT-induced inhibition of orexin neurons was prolonged. 
      In the absence of doxycycline, Orexin-tTA; TetO Htr1a mice exhibited severe 
      fragmentation of sleep/wakefulness during the first half of the dark period-the time 
      of maximal activity in nocturnal rodents-without affecting sleep/wakefulness during 
      the light period when sleep time is maximal. However, when the 5HT1A receptor in 
      orexin neurons was reduced to basal expression levels in the presence of 
      doxycycline, sleep/wakefulness patterns in Orexin-tTA; TetO Htr1a mice during the 
      early active period were indistinguishable from those of littermate TetO Htr1a mice. 
      These results strongly suggest that enhancement of inhibitory serotonergic input to 
      orexin neurons caused fragmentation of wakefulness. In contrast, sleep/wakefulness 
      architecture in the light period was unaffected by 5HT1A receptor overexpression in 
      the orexin neurons. CONCLUSION: Inhibitory serotonergic input likely functions as 
      negative feedback to orexin neurons in the early dark period and helps stabilize 
      wakefulness bouts, thereby contributing to the diurnal rhythm of sleep and 
      wakefulness.

AB  - Studies by Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K), rely on 30-sec epochs to score sleep 
      stages. In this paper, we introduce a new approach based on three consecutive and 
      non-consecutive 6-sec sub-epochs for the detection of the wake stage and stage 1 
      sleep. The Relative Spectral Energy Band (RSEB) is used as a feature extraction from 
      the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. Spectral estimation is performed using 
      non-parametric and parametric methods. We then compared the performance of the 
      conventional 30-sec epochs with the three consecutive and non-consecutive 6-sec 
      epochs. The outcomes of this study showed that while the accuracy varies between 
      subjects, the non-parametric method proved to be more effective with stage 1 sleep 
      detection and the parametric method was more effective for wake stage detection. The 
      non-consecutive sub-epoch method was more effective and consecutive method was least 
      effective in non-parametric stage 1 detection. Alternatively, the 30-second epoch 
      method was most effective for parametric wake stage detection.

AB  - This study characterizes the different response patterns of sleep and wakefulness 
      (W) to short light-dark (LD) cycles in albino mice and examines whether retinal 
      degeneration resulting from prolonged bright light treatment and/or rd/rd mutation 
      alters such response patterns. Eight young male Institute for Cancer Research (ICR) 
      mice with normal eyes, seven young male rd/rd Friend Virus B type (FVB) mice, six 
      young ICR and five young rd/rd FVB mice receiving 48-h bright light treatment, and 
      five older rd/rd FVB mice were implanted with skull and muscle electrodes to record 
      sleep and W. All the mice were maintained in 12-h-12-h LD cycles at baseline and 
      received 2 days of short LD cycle treatment, which included 5-min-5-min LD cycles 
      for a total of 24 cycles presented 4h after lights-on and again 4h after lights-off. 
      All the five mouse groups maintained photo-entrainment of sleep and W rhythms at the 
      baseline and showed a preference for paradoxical sleep (PS) occurrence in the 5-min 
      dark period and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) in the 5-min light period and a 
      brief alerting effect of light onset on experimental days. Retinal degeneration 
      rising from bright light treatment and/or genetic mutation failed to eliminate or 
      reduce the response of PS and NREMS to short LD cycles, although it enhanced the LD 
      contrast of W, i.e., bright light treatment prolonged the alerting effect of light 
      and the rd mutation increased the suppressing effect of the dark on W. These results 
      suggest that sleep responses to short LD cycles and the brief alerting effect of 
      light were independent of the photoreceptors in the outer retina. Furthermore, the 
      residual photoreceptors in the outer retina and/or the photosensitive cells in the 
      inner retina may actively modulate the effect of light and dark signals on W.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral diazepam, administered in varying doses, is among the few proposed 
      treatment options for electrical status epilepticus during slow wave sleep in 
      children. We sought to retrospectively evaluate the long-term efficacy of high-dose 
      oral diazepam in reducing electrographic and clinical evidence of electrical status 
      epilepticus during slow wave sleep in children. Additionally, we surveyed caregivers 
      to assess safety and behavioral outcomes related to ongoing therapy. METHODS: We 
      collected demographic and clinical data on children treated for electrical status 
      epilepticus during slow wave sleep between October 2010 and March 2013. We sought to 
      identify the number of patients who achieved at least a 50% reduction in spike wave 
      index on electroencephalograph after receiving high-dose oral diazepam. We also 
      administered a questionnaire to caregivers to assess for behavioral problems and 
      side effects. RESULTS: We identified 42 evaluable patients who received high-dose 
      diazepam (range 0.23-2.02 mg/kg per day) to treat electrical status epilepticus 
      during slow wave sleep. Twenty-six patients had spike reduction data and 18/26 
      (69.2%) children achieved a greater than 50% reduction in spike wave count from an 
      average of 15.54 to 5.05 (P = 0.001). We received 28 responses to the questionnaire. 
      Some patients experienced new onset of difficulties with problem-solving and speech 
      and writing development. Sleep disturbances (50%) and irritability (57.1%) were the 
      most frequent side effects reported. There did not appear to be a dose-related 
      effect with electroencephalograph changes, behavioral effects, or side effects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: High-dose oral diazepam significantly reduces the spike wave count on 
      electroencephalograph in children with electrical status epilepticus during slow 
      wave sleep. Although this therapy improves electroencephalograph-related findings, 
      it can be associated with concerning neurological and behavioral side effects in 
      some individuals, so further study is warranted.

AB  - This article explores transcendental experiences during meditation practice and the 
      integration of transcendental experiences and the unfolding of higher states of 
      consciousness with waking, dreaming, and sleeping. The subject/object relationship 
      during transcendental experiences is characterized by the absence of time, space, 
      and body sense--the framework that gives meaning to waking experiences. 
      Physiologically, transcendental experiences during Transcendental Meditation 
      practice are marked by slow inhalation, along with autonomic orientation at the 
      onset of breath changes and heightened α1 (8-10 Hz) frontal coherence. The 
      integration of transcendental experiences with waking, dreaming, and sleeping is 
      also marked by distinct subjective and objective markers. This integrated state, 
      called Cosmic Consciousness in the Vedic tradition, is subjectively marked by inner 
      self-awareness coexisting with waking, sleeping, and dreaming. Physiologically, 
      Cosmic Consciousness is marked by the coexistence of α1 electroencephalography (EEG) 
      with delta EEG during deep sleep, and higher brain integration, greater emotional 
      stability, and decreased anxiety during challenging tasks. Transcendental 
      experiences may be the engine that fosters higher human development.

AB  - Antidepressants have been used for treatment of ethanol withdrawal symptoms mainly 
      in observational studies. However, cortical frequency oscillation of ethanol 
      withdrawal treatment with antidepressants remained to be elucidated. This study 
      aimed to identify surrogate biomarkers that represent intact biological or ethanol 
      withdrawal processes and response to pretreatment with fluoxetine, a selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor, with quantitative methods. Adult male Wistar rats 
      implanted with electrodes over the frontal and parietal cortices were rendered 
      dependent on ethanol via modified liquid diet (MLD) containing ethanol. Then, 
      ethanol-containing MLD was replaced with isocaloric ethanol-free MLD to induce 
      ethanol withdrawal symptoms. Locomotor activity, sleep-wakefulness and spectral 
      frequencies of electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern during ethanol-withdrawal 
      period were analyzed. One-way ANOVA confirmed significant increases in locomotor 
      activity and time spent in awake state and decreases time spent in non-rapid eye 
      movement (NREM) sleep and REM-sleep during ethanol withdrawal period. Fast Fourier 
      Transformation also revealed predominant increases in gamma spectral powers within 
      both the frontal and parietal cortices during ethanol withdrawal. However, these 
      changes, except sleep-wake disturbances, were significantly attenuated by fluoxetine 
      pretreatment (10 mg/kg). The present study supports the hypothesis that serotonergic 
      hypofunction may underlie most of ethanol withdrawal symptoms and proposes that 
      electroencephalographic patterns are valid biomarkers for ethanol withdrawal 
      evaluation and treatment.

PG  - 1350012
LID - 10.1142/S0129065713500123 [doi]
AB  - This work proposes a methodology for sleep stage classification based on two main 
      approaches: the combination of features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      signal by different extraction methods, and the use of stacked sequential learning 
      to incorporate predicted information from nearby sleep stages in the final 
      classifier. The feature extraction methods used in this work include three 
      representative ways of extracting information from EEG signals: Hjorth features, 
      wavelet transformation and symbolic representation. Feature selection was then used 
      to evaluate the relevance of individual features from this set of methods. Stacked 
      sequential learning uses a second-layer classifier to improve the classification by 
      using previous and posterior first-layer predicted stages as additional features 
      providing information to the model. Results show that both approaches enhance the 
      sleep stage classification accuracy rate, thus leading to a closer approximation to 
      the experts' opinion.

      EEG: activation synchrony index (ASI).

AB  - The degree of interhemispheric synchrony in the neonatal EEG assessment refers to 
      the co-occurrence of activity bouts during quiet sleep or burst suppression, and it 
      has been widely considered as a key component in assessing background activity. 
      However, no objective measures have been published for measuring it, and all 
      conventionally used visual criteria suffer from significant ambiguities. Our present 
      study aimed to develop such a quantitative measure of (a)synchrony, called 
      activation synchrony index (ASI). We developed the ASI paradigm based on the testing 
      of statistical independence between two quantized amplitude envelopes of 
      wideband-filtered signals where higher frequencies had been pre-emphasized. The core 
      parameter settings of ASI paradigm were defined using a smaller EEG dataset, and the 
      final ASI paradigm was tested using a visually classified dataset of EEG records 
      from 33 fullterm and 25 preterm babies, which showed varying grades of asynchrony. 
      Our findings show that ASI could distinguish all EEG recordings with normal 
      synchrony from those with modest or severe asynchrony at individual level, and there 
      was a highly significant correlation (p<0.001) between ASI and the visually assessed 
      grade of asynchrony. In addition, we showed that i) ASI is stable in recordings over 
      several hours in duration, such as the typical neonatal brain monitoring, that ii) 
      ASI values are sensitive to sleep stage, and that iii) they correlate with age in 
      the preterm babies. Comparison of ASI to other three potential paradigms 
      demonstrated a significant competitive advantage. Finally, ASI was found to be 
      remarkably resistant to common artefacts as tested by adding significant level of 
      real EEG artefacts from noisy recordings. An objective and reliable measure of 
      (a)synchrony may open novel avenues for using ASI as a putative early functional 
      biomarker in the neonatal brain, as well as for building proper automated 
      classifiers of neonatal EEG background. Notably, the signature of synchrony of this 
      kind, temporal coincidence of activity bouts, is a common feature in biological 
      signals, suggesting that ASI may also hold promise as a useful paradigm for 
      assessing temporal synchrony in other biosignals as well, such as muscle activities 
      or movements.

AB  - A fundamental feature of human memory is the propensity for beneficial changes in 
      information storage after initial encoding. Recent research findings favor the 
      possibility that memory consolidation during sleep is instrumental for actively 
      maintaining the storehouse of memories that individuals carry through their lives. 
      The information that ultimately remains available for retrieval may tend to be that 
      which is reactivated during sleep. A novel source of support for this idea comes 
      from demonstrations that neurocognitive processing during sleep can benefit memory 
      storage when memories are covertly cued via auditory or olfactory stimulation. 
      Investigations of these subtle manipulations of memory processing during sleep can 
      help elucidate the mechanisms of memory preservation in the human brain.

      activity.

AB  - The study objective was to compare qualitatively the clinical features of patients 
      with electrical status epilepticus in sleep with focal versus generalized sleep 
      potentiated epileptiform activity. We enrolled patients 2 to 20 years of age, 
      studied between 2001 and 2009, and with sleep potentiated epileptiform activity 
      defined as an increase of epileptiform activity of 50% or more during non-rapid eye 
      movement sleep compared with wakefulness. Eighty-five patients met the inclusion 
      criteria, median age was 7.3 years, and 54 (63.5%) were boys. Sixty-seven (78.8%) 
      patients had focal sleep potentiated epileptiform activity, whereas 18 (21.2%) had 
      generalized sleep potentiated epileptiform activity. The 2 groups did not differ 
      with respect to sex, age, presence of a structural brain abnormality, epilepsy, or 
      other qualitative cognitive, motor, or behavioral problems. Our data suggest that 
      there are no qualitative differences in the clinical features of patients with focal 
      versus generalized sleep potentiated epileptiform activity.

TI  - Acute escitalopram treatment inhibits REM sleep rebound and activation of 
      MCH-expressing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus after long term selective REM 
      sleep deprivation.
PG  - 439-49
LID - 10.1007/s00213-013-3046-4 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Selective rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) deprivation using the 
      platform-on-water ("flower pot") method causes sleep rebound with increased REMS, 
      decreased REMS latency, and activation of the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) 
      expressing neurons in the hypothalamus. MCH is implicated in the pathomechanism of 
      depression regarding its influence on mood, feeding behavior, and REMS. OBJECTIVES: 
      We investigated the effects of the most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
      escitalopram on sleep rebound following REMS deprivation and, in parallel, on the 
      activation of MCH-containing neurons. METHODS: Escitalopram or vehicle (10 mg/kg, 
      intraperitoneally) was administered to REMS-deprived (72 h) or home cage male Wistar 
      rats. During the 3-h-long "rebound sleep", electroencephalography was recorded, 
      followed by an MCH/Fos double immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: During REMS rebound, 
      the time spent in REMS and the number of MCH/Fos double-labeled neurons in the 
      lateral hypothalamus increased markedly, and REMS latency showed a significant 
      decrease. All these effects of REMS deprivation were significantly attenuated by 
      escitalopram treatment. Besides the REMS-suppressing effects, escitalopram caused an 
      increase in amount of and decrease in latency of slow wave sleep during the rebound. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results show that despite the high REMS pressure caused by REMS 
      deprivation procedure, escitalopram has the ability to suppress REMS rebound, as 
      well as to diminish the activation of MCH-containing neurons, in parallel. 
      Escitalopram caused a shift from REMS to slow wave sleep during the rebound. 
      Furthermore, these data point to the potential connection between the serotonergic 
      system and MCH in sleep regulation, which can be relevant in depression and in other 
      mood disorders.

TI  - Genes involved in the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) are specifically 
      regulated in cortical astrocytes following sleep deprivation in mice.
PG  - 1445-58
LID - 10.5665/sleep.3034 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: There is growing evidence indicating that in order to meet the 
      neuronal energy demands, astrocytes provide lactate as an energy substrate for 
      neurons through a mechanism called "astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle" (ANLS). Since 
      neuronal activity changes dramatically during vigilance states, we hypothesized that 
      the ANLS may be regulated during the sleep-wake cycle. To test this hypothesis we 
      investigated the expression of genes associated with the ANLS specifically in 
      astrocytes following sleep deprivation. Astrocytes were purified by 
      fluorescence-activated cell sorting from transgenic mice expressing the green 
      fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the human astrocytic GFAP-promoter. 
      DESIGN: 6-hour instrumental sleep deprivation (TSD). SETTING: Animal sleep research 
      laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Young (P23-P27) FVB/N-Tg (GFAP-GFP) 14Mes/J (Tg) mice of 
      both sexes and 7-8 week male Tg and FVB/Nj mice. INTERVENTIONS: Basal sleep 
      recordings and sleep deprivation achieved using a modified cage where animals were 
      gently forced to move. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Since Tg and FVB/Nj mice displayed 
      a similar sleep-wake pattern, we performed a TSD in young Tg mice. Total RNA was 
      extracted from the GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells sorted from cerebral cortex. 
      Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that levels of Glut1, α-2-Na/K pump, Glt1, and 
      Ldha mRNAs were significantly increased following TSD in GFP-positive cells. In 
      GFP-negative cells, a tendency to increase, although not significant, was observed 
      for Ldha, Mct2, and α-3-Na/K pump mRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that TSD 
      induces the expression of genes associated with ANLS specifically in astrocytes, 
      underlying the important role of astrocytes in the maintenance of the 
      neuro-metabolic coupling across the sleep-wake cycle.

TI  - Parasomnia overlap disorder: a distinct pathophysiologic entity or a variant of 
      rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder? A case series.

LID - S1389-9457(13)01067-8 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parasomnia overlap disorder (POD) currently is classified by the 
      International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Second Edition (ICSD-2) as a 
      variant of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and therefore its 
      diagnosis also implies counseling the patients on the increased risk for developing 
      neurodegenerative disorders. POD pathophysiology is not clear to date. METHODS: The 
      authors report 5 cases of POD, review the literature, and analyze previously 
      published cases of POD. RESULTS: In all 5 reported cases sleep-related activity was 
      clearly demonstrated, though the RBD component was mild or incidentally discovered. 
      None of the patients had Parkinsonian clinical features. Based on ICSD-2 criteria, 
      there are 139 more POD cases reported in the literature and 69. 2% are idiopathic. 
      The POD patients had an earlier age of onset than the patients with RBD. The RBD 
      component was milder than the disorder of arousal (DOA) in most cases. Recently an 
      updated classification was published, which included new categories of POD. The 
      features mentioned above and the revised classification suggests that POD is not 
      just a subtype of RBD. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that POD is a distinct 
      pathophysiologic parasomnia. Further research to identify the underlying mechanism 
      is needed. Proper counseling is necessary for patients presenting with POD at a 
      young age of onset.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electrical status epilepticus during sleep is characterized by epilepsy, 
      a specific electroencephalographic pattern, and neuropsychological impairment. This 
      study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam in treating children 
      with electrical status epilepticus during sleep. METHODS: A multicenter, 
      retrospective, open-label study enrolled 73 children (mean age: 8 years) affected by 
      electrical status epilepticus during sleep. The efficacy was rated according to the 
      seizure frequency and electroencephalography response. RESULTS: After a mean 
      treatment period of 19 months (range: 6 to 24 months), 33 (63.5%) of 52 patients 
      became seizure-free or had experienced remarkable reduction in seizures. The 
      electrical status epilepticus of 41 (56.2%) of 73 patients disappeared off their 
      electroencephalography. The electroencephalography efficacy of levetiracetam 
      treatment was noted in the monotherapy (61.9%) and add-on (53.9%) groups. The 
      clinical (67.7%) and electroencephalography (64.3%) response rates of the idiopathic 
      group were better than those of the symptomatic group (57.1% and 45.2%, 
      respectively). No patient discontinued the trial because of intolerability of side 
      effects. CONCLUSIONS: Levetiracetam is effective in individuals with electrical 
      status epilepticus during sleep with tolerable side effects.

AB  - Continuous spike and wave in slow-wave sleep (CSWS) is an electroencephalographic 
      (EEG) pattern characterized by generalized spike-wave discharges occurring for at 
      least 85% of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, with marked attenuation during 
      rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. It has been described in a large number of 
      structural and nonstructural neurologic conditions and is associated with epilepsy, 
      behavioral disturbances, and severe neuropsychiatric impairment. We describe 
      continuous spike and wave in slow-wave sleep in 2 patients (one with Rett syndrome 
      and the other with Lhermitte-Duclos syndrome). To our knowledge, continuous spike 
      and wave in slow-wave sleep has not been previously described in these conditions.

AB  - Insight into the function of sleep may be gained by studying animals in the 
      ecological context in which sleep evolved. Until recently, technological constraints 
      prevented electroencephalogram (EEG) studies of animals sleeping in the wild. 
      However, the recent development of a small recorder (Neurologger 2) that animals can 
      carry on their head permitted the first recordings of sleep in nature. To facilitate 
      sleep studies in the field and to improve the welfare of experimental animals, 
      herein, we test the feasibility of using minimally invasive surface and subcutaneous 
      electrodes to record the EEG in barn owls. The EEG and behaviour of four adult owls 
      in captivity and of four chicks in a nest box in the field were recorded. We scored 
      a 24-h period for each adult bird for wakefulness, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and 
      rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep using 4 s epochs. Although the quality and stability 
      of the EEG signals recorded via subcutaneous electrodes were higher when compared to 
      surface electrodes, the owls' state was readily identifiable using either electrode 
      type. On average, the four adult owls spent 13.28 h awake, 9.64 h in SWS, and 1.05 h 
      in REM sleep. We demonstrate that minimally invasive methods can be used to measure 
      EEG-defined wakefulness, SWS, and REM sleep in owls and probably other animals.

      experiment "Mars-105"].
PG  - 135-40
AB  - Night-to-night stability of falling asleep and duration of wakefulness in the sleep 
      was studied in six healthy male subjects under conditions of 105-day isolation 
      experiment "Mars-105". Polysomnography records were carried out in each subject 
      during five nights taken in regular intervals within the experiment. Three subjects 
      demonstrated high stability of falling asleep and wakefulness in sleep (group I), 
      whereas in the remaining three subjects stability of these characteristics was low 
      (group [I). Delta-sleep was shown to be deepened in subjects of group II 
      (significant prevalence of stage 4 (47.3 min) over stage 3 (32.9 min)). In subjects 
      of group I, the duration of stage 3 was 44.9 min and that of stage 4 was 26.6 min. 
      We suggest that night-to-night instability of falling asleep and duration of 
      wakefulness in sleep in combination with delta sleep is the special individual form 
      of sleep adaptation to conditions of chronic isolation stress.

AB  - We present Activity Analysis as a new method for the quantification of subjective 
      reports of altered states of consciousness with regard to the indicated level of 
      simulated motor activity. Empirical linguistic activity analysis was conducted with 
      dream reports conceived immediately after EEG-controlled periods of hypnagogic 
      hallucinations and REM-sleep in the sleep laboratory. Reports of REM-dreams 
      exhibited a significantly higher level of simulated physical dreamer activity, while 
      hypnagogic hallucinations appear to be experienced mostly from the point of passive 
      observer. This study lays the groundwork for clinical research on the level of 
      simulated activity in pathologically altered states of subjective experience, for 
      example in the REM-dreams of clinically depressed patients, or in intrusions and 
      dreams of patients diagnosed with PTSD.

AB  - Sleep deprivation is followed by an increase in EEG delta power during recovery 
      sleep indicating an increased sleep propensity. Delta waves mostly reflect the 
      rhythmic recurring of generalized hyperpolarizations (DOWN state) in cortical 
      neurons causing large, deep-positive waves in the LFP. Enhancement of delta power in 
      recovery sleep can be the consequence of either the more frequent occurrence, or the 
      higher amplitude caused by higher synchrony, or the longer duration of these DOWN 
      states. In the present experiments, we examined these possibilities and found the 
      strongest increase in the incidence of slow deep positive LFP waves (slow waves) 
      following sleep deprivation indicating enhancement of DOWN state inducing and/or 
      weakening of UP state maintaining processes. The strong decrease in multiunit 
      activity during slow waves was preceded by a gradual buildup of activity. The 
      significant correlation between these changes both in control and recovery 
      recordings indicate that excitation might determine the subsequent drop in activity. 
      Increased sensitivity of cortical neurons to excitation might offer an explanation 
      for this observation. Current-source-density analysis indicated in our experiments 
      that the first sources during DOWN states appeared in layer III-IV. Activation was 
      then displaced to layer V. In the motor cortex, both corticocortical and 
      thalamocortical fibers terminate in layer III that provides a strong feedforward 
      excitation to layer V. As propagation of facilitatory signals through cortical 
      layers is downwardly biased, disfacilitation might also follow this pattern. Sleep 
      deprivation caused only quantitative differences in the sink-source patterns, 
      indicating that existing processes were enhanced by sleep deprivation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to specify, by reference to the normal 
      newborn, the current contribution of the electroencephalogram (EEG) to the diagnosis 
      and prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in the full-term newborn. 
      Both digitized traditional EEG and cerebral function monitoring will be considered. 
      DISCUSSION: A good knowledge of the EEG features of the sleep-wake cycle (SWC) is a 
      prerequisite. We first describe the main features of normal and pathological EEGs. 
      Very early recordings (before 6hours of life) are needed to indicate any required 
      neuroprotective (hypothermia) and other (sedation, anticonvulsivants) treatments. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Between the normal or near-normal tracings, which are associated with a 
      good prognosis, and the very pathological ones (inactive, paroxysmal), which are 
      associated with a poor vital or neurological prognosis, the interpretation of 
      "intermediate" tracings--mainly represented by other types of discontinuous 
      tracings--must take into account characteristics such as bursts and discontinuities, 
      postnatal age, evolution of successive tracings, and treatments.

AB  - In humans, a first night effect (FNE) is characterized by increased sleep latency 
      and decreased total sleep time in an unfamiliar environment, but the mechanism and 
      treatment options for this universally experienced acute insomnia are unclear. We 
      continuously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) and 
      measured plasma corticosterone levels to develop a mouse FNE model by inducing acute 
      insomnia in mice that have been placed in unfamiliar cage environments. The sleep 
      latency of mice 'moved to clean cages' (MCC) was longer than that for mice 'moved to 
      dirty ones' (MDC). As compared to MDC mice, MCC mice showed stronger decreases in 
      the amount of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM, NREM) and REM sleep, with a lower 
      power density of NREM sleep, increased fragmentation and decreased stage transitions 
      from NREM sleep to wake, and higher variation in plasma corticosterone levels. 
      Treatment of MCC mice with zolpidem, diazepam, raclopride, pyrilamine, except 
      SCH23390 shortened NREM sleep latency. In addition, zolpidem significantly increased 
      NREM and REM sleep with the increase in slow wave activity (1.00-2.75 Hz), while 
      raclopride significantly increased NREM and REM sleep without changing the EEG power 
      density in MCC mice, whereas diazepam increased sleep with a drastic decrease in 
      power density of the frequency band between 1.00 and 4.00 Hz, diazepam also 
      increased the frequency band between 9.75 and 24.75 Hz during NREM sleep. These 
      results indicate that a MCC mouse can mimic a FNE phenotype of humans and that 
      zolpidem and raclopride may be useful drugs to prevent acute insomnia, including 
      FNE.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to detect one of the constituent brain waveforms in 
      electroencephalography (EEG), the K-complex (KC). The role and significance of the 
      KC include its engagement in information processing, sleep protection, and memory 
      consolidation [1]. The method applies a two-step methodology in which first all the 
      candidate KC waves are extracted based on fundamental morphological features 
      imitating visual criteria. Subsequently each candidate wave is classified as KC or 
      outlier according to its similarity to a set of different patterns (clusters) of 
      annotated KCs. The different clusters are constructed by applying graph partitioning 
      on the training set based on spectral clustering and exhibit temporal similarities 
      in both signal and frequency content. The method was applied in whole-night sleep 
      activity recorded using multiple EEG electrodes. Cross-validation was performed 
      against visual scoring of singular generalized KCs during all sleep cycles and 
      showed high sensitivity in KC detection.

LID - 10.5665/sleep.2388 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the reflex and corticobulbar motor 
      excitability of jaw muscles is reduced during sleep. DESIGN: Polysomnographic 
      recordings in the electrophysiological study. SETTING: University sleep research 
      laboratories. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: The reflex and corticobulbar motor 
      excitability of jaw muscles was determined during the quiet awake state (QW) and 
      quiet sleep (QS) in monkeys (n = 4). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During QS sleep, 
      compared to QW periods, both tongue stimulation-evoked jaw-opening reflex peak and 
      root mean square amplitudes were significantly decreased with stimulations at 2-3.5 
      × thresholds (P < 0.001). The jaw-opening reflex latency during sleep was also 
      significantly longer than during QW. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) within 
      the cortical masticatory area induced rhythmic jaw movements at a stable threshold 
      (≤ 60 μA) during QW; but during QS, ICMS failed to induce any rhythmic jaw movements 
      at the maximum ICMS intensity used, although sustained jaw-opening movements were 
      evoked at significantly increased threshold (P < 0.001) in one of the monkeys. 
      Similarly, during QW, ICMS within face primary motor cortex induced orofacial 
      twitches at a stable threshold (≤ 35 μA), but the ICMS thresholds were elevated 
      during QS. Soon after the animal awoke, rhythmic jaw movements and orofacial 
      twitches could be evoked at thresholds similar to those before QS. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results suggest that the excitability of reflex and corticobulbar-evoked activity in 
      the jaw motor system is depressed during QS.

AB  - Neuronal activity differs between wakefulness and sleep states. In contrast, an 
      attractor state, called self-organized critical (SOC), was proposed to govern brain 
      dynamics because it allows for optimal information coding. But is the human brain 
      SOC for each vigilance state despite the variations in neuronal dynamics? We 
      characterized neuronal avalanches--spatiotemporal waves of enhanced activity--from 
      dense intracranial depth recordings in humans. We showed that avalanche 
      distributions closely follow a power law--the hallmark feature of SOC--for each 
      vigilance state. However, avalanches clearly differ with vigilance states: slow wave 
      sleep (SWS) shows large avalanches, wakefulness intermediate, and rapid eye movement 
      (REM) sleep small ones. Our SOC model, together with the data, suggested first that 
      the differences are mediated by global but tiny changes in synaptic strength, and 
      second, that the changes with vigilance states reflect small deviations from 
      criticality to the subcritical regime, implying that the human brain does not 
      operate at criticality proper but close to SOC. Independent of criticality, the 
      analysis confirms that SWS shows increased correlations between cortical areas, and 
      reveals that REM sleep shows more fragmented cortical dynamics.

AB  - Drowsiness is one of the main causal factors in many traffic accidents due to the 
      clear decline in the attention and recognition of danger drivers, diminishing 
      vehicle-handling abilities. The aim of this research is to develop an automatic 
      method to detect the drowsiness stage in EEG records using time, spectral and 
      wavelet analysis. A total of 19 features were computed from only one EEG channel to 
      differentiate the alertness and drowsiness stages. After a selection process based 
      on lambda of Wilks criterion, 7 parameters were chosen to feed a Neural Network 
      classifier. Eighteen EEG records were analyzed. The method gets 87.4% and 83.6% of 
      alertness and drowsiness correct detections rates, respectively. The results 
      obtained indicate that the parameters can differentiate both stages. The features 
      are easy to calculate and can be obtained in real time. Those variables could be 
      used in an automatic drowsiness detection system in vehicles, thereby decreasing the 
      rate of accidents caused by sleepiness of the driver.

TI  - Differential effects on fast and slow spindle activity, and the sleep slow 
      oscillation in humans with carbamazepine and flunarizine to antagonize 
      voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channel activity.
PG  - 905-11

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep spindles play an important functional role in 
      sleep-dependent memory consolidation. They are a hallmark of non-rapid eye movement 
      (NREM) sleep and are grouped by the sleep slow oscillation. Spindles are not a 
      unitary phenomenon but are differentiated by oscillatory frequency and topography. 
      Yet, it is still a matter of debate whether these differences relate to different 
      generating mechanisms. As corticothalamic networks are known to be involved in the 
      generation of spindles and the slow oscillation, with Ca2+ and Na+ conductances 
      playing crucial roles, we employed the actions of carbamazepine and flunarizine to 
      reduce the efficacy of Na+ and Ca2+ channels, respectively, for probing in healthy 
      human subjects mechanisms of corticothalamocortical excitability. DESIGN: For each 
      pharmacologic substance a within-design study was conducted on 2 experimental nights 
      in young, healthy adults. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Results indicate differential 
      effects for slow frontocortical (approximately 10 Hz) and fast centroparietal 
      (approximately 14 Hz) spindles. Carbamazepine enhanced slow frontal spindle activity 
      conjointly with an increment in slow oscillation power (approximately 0.75 Hz) 
      during deep NREM sleep. In contrast, fast centroparietal spindle activity 
      (approximately 14 Hz) was decreased by carbamazepine. Flunarizine also decreased 
      fast-spindle electroencephalogram power, but affected neither slow frontal spindle 
      nor slow oscillation frequency bands. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a 
      differential pharmacologic response of the two types of sleep spindles and 
      underscore a close linkage of the generating mechanisms underlying the sleep slow 
      oscillation and the slow frontal sleep spindles for the signal transmission 
      processes manipulated in the current study.

TI  - Metric learning for automatic sleep stage classification.
PG  - 5025-8
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610677 [doi]
AB  - We introduce in this paper a metric learning approach for automatic sleep stage 
      classification based on single-channel EEG data. We show that learning a global 
      metric from training data instead of using the default Euclidean metric, the 
      k-nearest neighbor classification rule outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 
      Sleep-EDF dataset with various classification settings. The overall accuracy for 
      Awake/Sleep and 4-class classification setting are 98.32% and 94.49% respectively. 
      Furthermore, the superior accuracy is achieved by performing classification on a 
      low-dimensional feature space derived from time and frequency domains and without 
      the need for artifact removal as a preprocessing step.

TI  - CRS-R score in disorders of consciousness is strongly related to spectral EEG at 
      rest.
PG  - 2348-56
LID - 10.1007/s00415-013-6982-3 [doi]
AB  - Patients suffering from disorders of consciousness still present a diagnostic 
      challenge due to the fact that their assessment is mainly based on behavioral scales 
      with their motor responses often being strongly impaired. We therefore focused on 
      resting electroencephalography (EEG) in order to reveal potential alternative 
      measures of the patient's current state independent of rather complex abilities 
      (e.g., language comprehension). Resting EEG was recorded in nine minimally conscious 
      state (MCS) and eight vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) 
      patients. Behavioral assessments were conducted using the Coma-Recovery 
      Scale-Revised (CRS-R). The signal was analyzed in the frequency domain and 
      association between resting EEG and CRS-R score as well as clinical diagnosis were 
      calculated using Pearson correlation and repeated-measures ANOVAs. The analyses 
      revealed robust positive correlations between CRS-R score and ratios between 
      frequencies above 8 Hz and frequencies below 8 Hz. Furthermore, the frequency of the 
      spectral peak was also highly indicative of the patient's CRS-R score. Concerning 
      differences between clinical diagnosis and healthy controls, it could be revealed 
      that while VS/UWS patients showed higher delta and theta activity than controls, MCS 
      did not differ from controls in this frequency range. Alpha activity, on the other 
      hand, was strongly decreased in both patient groups as compared to controls. The 
      strong relationship between various resting EEG parameters and CRS-R score provides 
      significant clinical relevance. Not only is resting activity easily acquired at 
      bedside, but furthermore, it does not depend on explicit cooperation of the patient. 
      Especially in cases where behavioral assessment is difficult or ambiguous, spectral 
      analysis of resting EEG can therefore complement clinical diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns in very low birth weight 
      premature newborns when reaching term-to-term neonates, thereby comparing extra 
      uterine to intra uterine development. METHODS: EEG recordings were obtained between 
      2 and 14 days of life in 47 preterm (<37 weeks) very low birth weight (⩽1500 g) 
      newborns and repeated when reaching term age (38-42 weeks) in a subsample (n=22). 
      EEG recordings were also obtained in term newborns. Clinical evaluation was 
      performed at birth and at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Relative to the first EEG, 
      preterm newborns showed a reduction in delta brushes and interburst intervals and 
      increased interhemispheric synchrony, suggesting an improvement in EEG maturation. 
      Further organization in sleep patterns, like a reduction in total sleep time and 
      phase shifts, were also observed. However, when reaching term, preterm newborns 
      still had less mature EEG patterns, phase shifts and transitional sleep than matched 
      controls. Background abnormalities and dysmaturity in preterm newborns during the 
      first EEG predicted adverse neurological outcome later on. CONCLUSIONS: EEG patterns 
      in preterm very low birth weight newborns might be influenced by extra uterine 
      development. Specific EEG abnormalities are related to increased risk of 
      neurological disorders. SIGNIFICANCE: Extra uterine development of very low birth 
      weight delays the acquisition of maturational EEG patterns.

TI  - Individual differences in white matter diffusion affect sleep oscillations.
PG  - 227-33
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2030-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - The characteristic oscillations of the sleeping brain, spindles and slow waves, show 
      trait-like, within-subject stability and a remarkable interindividual variability 
      that correlates with functionally relevant measures such as memory performance and 
      intelligence. Yet, the mechanisms underlying these interindividual differences are 
      largely unknown. Spindles and slow waves are affected by the recent history of 
      learning and neuronal activation, indicating sensitivity to changes in synaptic 
      strength and thus to the connectivity of the neuronal network. Because the 
      structural backbone of this network is formed by white matter tracts, we 
      hypothesized that individual differences in spindles and slow waves depend on the 
      white matter microstructure across a distributed network. We recorded both 
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images and whole-night, high-density 
      electroencephalography and investigated whether individual differences in sleep 
      spindle and slow wave parameters were associated with diffusion tensor imaging 
      metrics; white matter fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity were quantified 
      using tract-based spatial statistics. Individuals with higher spindle power had 
      higher axial diffusivity in the forceps minor, the anterior corpus callosum, 
      fascicles in the temporal lobe, and the tracts within and surrounding the thalamus. 
      Individuals with a steeper rising slope of the slow wave had higher axial 
      diffusivity in the temporal fascicle and frontally located white matter tracts 
      (forceps minor, anterior corpus callosum). These results indicate that the profiles 
      of sleep oscillations reflect not only the dynamics of the neuronal network at the 
      synaptic level, but also the localized microstructural properties of its structural 
      backbone, the white matter tracts.

PG  - 5386-9
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610766 [doi]
AB  - Hypoglycemia is the most common but highly feared complication induced by the 
      intensive insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). 
      Nocturnal hypoglycemia is dangerous because sleep obscures early symptoms and 
      potentially leads to severe episodes which can cause seizure, coma, or even death. 
      It is shown that the hypoglycemia onset induces early changes in 
      electroencephalography (EEG) signals which can be detected non-invasively. In our 
      research, EEG signals from five T1DM patients during an overnight clamp study were 
      measured and analyzed. By applying a method of feature extraction using Fast Fourier 
      Transform (FFT) and classification using neural networks, we establish that 
      hypoglycemia can be detected efficiently using EEG signals from only two channels. 
      This paper demonstrates that by implementing a training process of combining genetic 
      algorithm and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, the classification results are improved 
      markedly up to 75% sensitivity and 60% specificity on a separate testing set.

AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is the most common neurobehavioral disorder 
      in children and frequently associated with epilepsy. For patients with both 
      conditions, methylphenidate remains a mainstay in the treatment of behavioral 
      problems. Most studies demonstrate that methylphenidate is effective in treating 
      children with well-controlled epilepsy, and that methylphenidate does not increase 
      the risk of having seizures in patients with EEG abnormalities without epilepsy. 
      However, in patients with active seizures, the results are somewhat contradictory. 
      This article presents the case of a young girl with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder and behavioral problems on Depakote (valproic acid) who had an abnormal EEG 
      with left centroparietal spikes but no history of electrographic seizures. She 
      experienced a convulsion the day after her first dose of methylphenidate, and repeat 
      EEG demonstrated continuous spike and slow wave during sleep. This case report 
      suggests that children with continuous spike and slow wave during sleep may have a 
      higher risk of developing seizures with methylphenidate treatment.

TI  - Rhythmic alternating patterns of brain activity distinguish rapid eye movement sleep 
      from other states of consciousness.
PG  - 10300-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1217691110 [doi]
AB  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep constitutes a distinct "third state" of 
      consciousness, during which levels of brain activity are commensurate with 
      wakefulness, but conscious awareness is radically transformed. To characterize the 
      temporal and spatial features of this paradoxical state, we examined functional 
      interactions between brain regions using fMRI resting-state connectivity methods. 
      Supporting the view that the functional integrity of the default mode network (DMN) 
      reflects "level of consciousness," we observed functional uncoupling of the DMN 
      during deep sleep and recoupling during REM sleep (similar to wakefulness). However, 
      unlike either deep sleep or wakefulness, REM was characterized by a more widespread, 
      temporally dynamic interaction between two major brain systems: unimodal 
      sensorimotor areas and the higher-order association cortices (including the DMN), 
      which normally regulate their activity. During REM, these two systems become 
      anticorrelated and fluctuate rhythmically, in reciprocally alternating multisecond 
      epochs with a frequency ranging from 0.1 to 0.01 Hz. This unique spatiotemporal 
      pattern suggests a model for REM sleep that may be consistent with its role in dream 
      formation and memory consolidation.

TI  - Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike and wave during sleep associated to 
      periventricular leukomalacia.
PG  - 1479-85
LID - 10.1177/0883073813508223 [doi]
AB  - Periventricular leukomalacia is the most common type of brain injury in premature 
      infants. Our aim is to describe the frequency and the features of epilepsy in a 
      single-center population of 137 children with periventricular leukomalacia. 
      Forty-two of the 137 (31%) patients presented epilepsy. Twelve percent of these 
      patients presented West syndrome, whereas 19% showed a pattern of continuous 
      spike-waves during slow sleep syndrome. In the latter group, outcome was frequently 
      unfavorable, with a greater number of seizures and more drug resistance. A 
      significant association was found between epilepsy and neonatal seizures, spastic 
      tetraplegia, and mental retardation. Although less common than in other forms of 
      brain injury, epilepsy is nevertheless a significant complication in children with 
      periventricular leukomalacia. The fairly frequent association with continuous 
      spike-waves during slow sleep syndrome deserves particular attention: 
      electroencephalographic sleep monitoring is important in order to provide early 
      treatment and prevent further neurologic deterioration.

      physiological and therapeutic effects].
PG  - 91-105
AB  - Neocortical EEG slow wave activity (SWA) in the delta frequency band (0.5-4.0 Hz) is 
      a hallmark of slow wave sleep (SWS) and its power is a function of prior wake 
      duration and an indicator of a sleep need. SWS is considered the most important 
      stage for realization of recovery functions of sleep. Possibility of impact on 
      characteristics of a night sleep by rhythmic (0.8-1.2 Hz) subthreshold 
      electrocutaneous stimulation of a hand during SWS is shown: 1st night--adaptation, 
      2nd night--control, 3d and 4th nights--with stimulation during SWA stages ofa SWS. 
      Stimulation caused significant increase in average duration of SWS and EEG SWA power 
      (in 11 of 16 subjects), and also well-being and mood improvement in subjects with 
      lowered emotional tone. It is supposed that the received result is caused by 
      functioning of a hypothetical mechanism directed on maintenance and deepening of SWS 
      and counteracting activating, awakening influences of the afferent stimulation. The 
      results can be of value both for understanding the physiological mechanisms of sleep 
      homeostasis and for development of non-pharmacological therapy of sleep disorders.

AB  - In adult brain tissue, thyroid hormones are known to have multiple effects which are 
      not mediated by chronic influences of the hormones on heterodimeric thyroid hormone 
      nuclear receptors. Previous work has shown that acute microinjections of 
      l-triiodothyronine (T3) to the preoptic region significantly influence EEG-defined 
      sleep in hypothyroid rats. The current study examined the effects of similar 
      microinjections in euthyroid rats. In 7 rats with histologically confirmed 
      microinjection sites bilaterally placed in the preoptic region, slow-wave sleep time 
      was significantly decreased, but REM and waking were increased as compared to 
      vehicle-injected controls. The EEG-defined parameters were significantly influenced 
      by the microinjections in a biphasic dose-response relationship; the lowest (0.3μg) 
      and highest (10μg) doses tested were without significant effect while intermediate 
      doses (1 and 3μg) induced significant differences from controls. There were 
      significant diurnal variations in the measures, yet no significant interactions 
      between the effect of hormone and time of day were demonstrated. Core body 
      temperature was not significantly altered in the current study. The demonstration of 
      effects of T3 within hours instead of days is consistent with a rapid mechanism of 
      action such as a direct influence on neurotransmission. Since the T3-mediated 
      effects were robust in the current work, euthyroid rats retain thyroid hormone 
      sensitivity which would be needed if sleep-regulatory mechanisms in the preoptic 
      region are continuously modulated by the hormones. This article is part of a Special 
      Issue entitled LInked: BRES-D-12-01552 & BRES-D-12-01363R2.

AB  - Real-life signals such as biomedical signals are non-stationary and random in their 
      pattern, and cannot be characterized by any specific waveform or spectral content. 
      Processing of these natural signals involves consideration of certain significant 
      attributes such as their non-stationary behavior over time, scaling behavior, 
      translation invariance. Due to their random behavior, the existing discriminative 
      methods often fail to provide a reasonable quantification performance, thereby 
      resulting in poor classification rates. In order to address this issue, there exists 
      a need for defining a suitable theoretical framework for biomedical signals. We have 
      proposed, a robust Time-Frequency Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (TF-NMF) 
      framework that uses sparse representation for quantification of sleep signals. This 
      scheme incorporates a novel feature extraction algorithm. For signals that are 
      nonstationary in nature, the degree of sparsity is lower compared to the stationary 
      signals. This results into poor classification accuracy. However our proposed 
      approach has proven that using NMF as input to the sparse representation for 
      classification will improve the discrimination performance. Overall, maximum 
      cross-validation performance of 87:9% was obtained, using the leave-one-out (LOO) 
      approach for sleep abnormality detection using EMG signals. Although the 
      computational complexity of the proposed algorithm might be higher compared to the 
      other similar methods, this TF-NMF based method shows great potential for 
      quantification and localization of time varying signals.

LID - 10.1111/jsr.12033 [doi]
AB  - Studies suggest that the consolidation of newly acquired memories and underlying 
      long-term synaptic plasticity might represent a major function of sleep. In a 
      combined repeated-measures and parallel-group sleep laboratory study (active waking 
      versus sleep, passive waking versus sleep), we provide evidence that brief periods 
      of daytime sleep (42.1 ± 8.9 min of non-rapid eye movement sleep) in healthy 
      adolescents (16 years old, all female), compared with equal periods of waking, 
      promote the consolidation of declarative memory (word-pairs) in participants with 
      high power in the electroencephalographic sleep spindle (sigma) frequency range. 
      This observation supports the notion that sleep-specific brain activity when 
      reaching a critical dose, beyond a mere reduction of interference, promotes synaptic 
      plasticity in a hippocampal-neocortical network that underlies the consolidation of 
      declarative memory.

TI  - Induction of slow oscillations by rhythmic acoustic stimulation.
PG  - 22-31

AB  - Slow oscillations are electrical potential oscillations with a spectral peak 
      frequency of ∼0.8 Hz, and hallmark the electroencephalogram during slow-wave sleep. 
      Recent studies have indicated a causal contribution of slow oscillations to the 
      consolidation of memories during slow-wave sleep, raising the question to what 
      extent such oscillations can be induced by external stimulation. Here, we examined 
      whether slow oscillations can be effectively induced by rhythmic acoustic 
      stimulation. Human subjects were examined in three conditions: (i) with tones 
      presented at a rate of 0.8 Hz ('0.8-Hz stimulation'); (ii) with tones presented at a 
      random sequence ('random stimulation'); and (iii) with no tones presented in a 
      control condition ('sham'). Stimulation started during wakefulness before sleep and 
      continued for the first ∼90 min of sleep. Compared with the other two conditions, 
      0.8-Hz stimulation significantly delayed sleep onset. However, once sleep was 
      established, 0.8-Hz stimulation significantly increased and entrained endogenous 
      slow oscillation activity. Sleep after the 90-min period of stimulation did not 
      differ between the conditions. Our data show that rhythmic acoustic stimulation can 
      be used to effectively enhance slow oscillation activity. However, the effect 
      depends on the brain state, requiring the presence of stable non-rapid eye movement 
      sleep.

TI  - Brain reactivity differentiates subjects with high and low dream recall frequencies 
      during both sleep and wakefulness.
PG  - 1206-15
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhs388 [doi]
AB  - The neurophysiological correlates of dreaming remain unclear. According to the 
      "arousal-retrieval" model, dream encoding depends on intrasleep wakefulness. 
      Consistent with this model, subjects with high and low dream recall frequency (DRF) 
      report differences in intrasleep awakenings. This suggests a possible 
      neurophysiological trait difference between the 2 groups. To test this hypothesis, 
      we compared the brain reactivity (evoked potentials) of subjects with high (HR, N = 
      18) and low (LR, N = 18) DRF during wakefulness and sleep. During data acquisition, 
      the subjects were presented with sounds to be ignored (first names randomly 
      presented among pure tones) while they were watching a silent movie or sleeping. 
      Brain responses to first names dramatically differed between the 2 groups during 
      both sleep and wakefulness. During wakefulness, the attention-orienting brain 
      response (P3a) and a late parietal response were larger in HR than in LR. During 
      sleep, we also observed between-group differences at the latency of the P3a during 
      N2 and at later latencies during all sleep stages. Our results demonstrate 
      differences in the brain reactivity of HR and LR during both sleep and wakefulness. 
      These results suggest that the ability to recall dreaming is associated with a 
      particular cerebral functional organization, regardless of the state of vigilance.

AB  - Mast cell activation and degranulation can result in the release of various chemical 
      mediators, such as histamine and cytokines, which significantly affect sleep. Mast 
      cells also exist in the central nervous system (CNS). Since up to 50% of histamine 
      contents in the brain are from brain mast cells, mediators from brain mast cells may 
      significantly influence sleep and other behaviors. In this study, we examined 
      potential involvement of brain mast cells in sleep/wake regulations, focusing 
      especially on the histaminergic system, using mast cell deficient (W/W(v)) mice. No 
      significant difference was found in the basal amount of sleep/wake between W/W(v) 
      mice and their wild-type littermates (WT), although W/W(v) mice showed increased EEG 
      delta power and attenuated rebound response after sleep deprivation. 
      Intracerebroventricular injection of compound 48/80, a histamine releaser from mast 
      cells, significantly increased histamine levels in the ventricular region and 
      enhanced wakefulness in WT mice, while it had no effect in W/W(v) mice. Injection of 
      H1 antagonists (triprolidine and mepyramine) significantly increased the amounts of 
      slow-wave sleep in WT mice, but not in W/W(v) mice. Most strikingly, the 
      food-seeking behavior observed in WT mice during food deprivation was completely 
      abolished in W/W(v) mice. W/W(v) mice also exhibited higher anxiety and depression 
      levels compared to WT mice. Our findings suggest that histamine released from brain 
      mast cells is wake-promoting, and emphasizes the physiological and pharmacological 
      importance of brain mast cells in the regulation of sleep and fundamental 
      neurobehavior.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Simple methods of sleepiness assessment are greatly needed for both 
      fundamental research and practical applications. The Karolinska drowsiness test 
      (KDT) was applied to construct physiological alertness scales and to validate them 
      against such well-known instrument of subjective sleepiness assessment as the 
      Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS). METHODS: Seven-min EEG recordings were obtained 
      with 2-h interval from frontal and occipital derivations during the last 32-50 h of 
      44-61-h wakefulness of 15 healthy study participants. Occipital alpha-theta power 
      difference and frontal and occipital scores on the 2nd principal component of the 
      EEG spectrum were calculated for each one-min interval of 5-min eyes closed section 
      of the record. RESULTS: To obtain scores (from 0 to 5) on alertness scales for each 
      of these EEG indexes, all positive one-min values of the index were assigned to 1, 
      and all remaining (negative) values were assigned to 0. Scores on any of the 
      physiological alertness scales were found to be strongly associated with KSS scores. 
      CONCLUSION: Physiological analogues of KSS were offered by utilising the EEG 
      recordings on eyes closed interval of KDT. SIGNIFICANCE: The constructed 
      physiological scales can help in improving validity and user-friendliness of the 
      field and laboratory methods of quantification of drowsy state.

TI  - [Relationship between degree of white matter damage and EEG changes in premature 
      infants early after birth].
PG  - 321-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between the degree of white matter damage and 
      changes in brain function in premature infants early after birth according to 
      amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) and raw EEG (with burst-suppression 
      patterns). METHODS: Thirty-eight premature infants of less than 32 weeks' 
      gestational age and with white matter damage, including 20 cases of mild white 
      matter damage and 18 cases of severe white matter damage, were included in the 
      study. Forty-two premature infants without white matter damage were selected as a 
      control group. After birth, they were examined using aEEG and brain ultrasound once 
      a week until four weeks after birth or a corrected gestational age of 32 weeks. The 
      white matter damage and control groups were compared in terms of aEEG patterns and 
      amplitudes and burst suppression ratio (BSR) on EEG. RESULTS: The white matter 
      damage and control groups had highly discontinuous patterns and had no complete 
      sleep cycles. The lower amplitude was significantly smaller in the severe white 
      matter damage subgroup than in the mild white matter damage subgroup and control 
      group. There was alternating burst-suppression activity on the raw EEG in the white 
      matter damage and control groups; and the severe white matter damage subgroup had a 
      significantly longer suppression time and a significantly higher BSR on EEG compared 
      with the mild white matter damage subgroup and control group. CONCLUSIONS: Brain 
      function monitoring should be performed in premature infants with white matter 
      damage early after birth so as to detect cases of severe white matter damage in 
      time.

AB  - The integration of segregated brain functional modules is a prerequisite for 
      conscious awareness during wakeful rest. Here, we test the hypothesis that temporal 
      integration, measured as long-term memory in the history of neural activity, is 
      another important quality underlying conscious awareness. For this aim, we study the 
      temporal memory of blood oxygen level-dependent signals across the human nonrapid 
      eye movement sleep cycle. Results reveal that this property gradually decreases from 
      wakefulness to deep nonrapid eye movement sleep and that such decreases affect areas 
      identified with default mode and attention networks. Although blood oxygen 
      level-dependent spontaneous fluctuations exhibit nontrivial spatial organization, 
      even during deep sleep, they also display a decreased temporal complexity in 
      specific brain regions. Conversely, this result suggests that long-range temporal 
      dependence might be an attribute of the spontaneous conscious mentation performed 
      during wakeful rest.

      with microsleep].
PG  - 141-53
AB  - We tested our earlier suggested hypothesis that one of mechanisms for failures of 
      performance of behavioural tasks during microsleep is a spontaneous generation of 
      ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves that suppress transmission of visual 
      information from the retina via lateral geniculate nucleus to primary visual 
      cortical areas and the striatum, and therefore significantly impair visual 
      perception and attention. Experiments were done during the nighttime. Monotonic 
      testing during performance of the two-alternative psychomotor test invoked 
      participants into a state defined as a microsleep with open eyes. For each 
      participant we made a comparative analysis of intensity of EEG spectrum during state 
      of microsleep with open eyes when failure in test performance occurred and during 
      accurate performance in waking state. Following trends in changes of EEG spectrum 
      were found: increase in intensity of low alpha-range, and decrease in intensity of 
      high alpha- and beta-ranges. Changes in theta-, low beta- and gamma-ranges were 
      differently directed. Taking into account the known from the literature data these 
      changes specify decrease in activation of primary visual cortical areas. Revealed 
      data could support our hypothesis concerning mechanism of visual-motor disturbances 
      during microsleep with open eyes.

AB  - EEG-fMRI is a unique method to combine the high temporal resolution of EEG with the 
      high spatial resolution of MRI to study generators of intrinsic brain signals such 
      as sleep grapho-elements or epileptic spikes. While the standard EPI sequence in 
      fMRI experiments has a temporal resolution of around 2.5-3s a newly established fast 
      fMRI sequence called MREG (Magnetic-Resonance-Encephalography) provides a temporal 
      resolution of around 100ms. This technical novelty promises to improve statistics, 
      facilitate correction of physiological artifacts and improve the understanding of 
      epileptic networks in fMRI. The present study compares simultaneous EEG-EPI and 
      EEG-MREG analyzing epileptic spikes to determine the yield of fast MRI in the 
      analysis of intrinsic brain signals. Patients with frequent interictal spikes 
      (>3/20min) underwent EEG-MREG and EEG-EPI (3T, 20min each, voxel size 3×3×3mm, EPI 
      TR=2.61s, MREG TR=0.1s). Timings of the spikes were used in an event-related 
      analysis to generate activation maps of t-statistics. (FMRISTAT, |t|>3.5, cluster 
      size: 7 voxels, p<0.05 corrected). For both sequences, the amplitude and location of 
      significant BOLD activations were compared with the spike topography. 13 patients 
      were recorded and 33 different spike types could be analyzed. Peak T-values were 
      significantly higher in MREG than in EPI (p<0.0001). Positive BOLD effects 
      correlating with the spike topography were found in 8/29 spike types using the EPI 
      and in 22/33 spikes types using the MREG sequence. Negative BOLD responses in the 
      default mode network could be observed in 3/29 spike types with the EPI and in 19/33 
      with the MREG sequence. With the latter method, BOLD changes were observed even when 
      few spikes occurred during the investigation. Simultaneous EEG-MREG thus is possible 
      with good EEG quality and shows higher sensitivity in regard to the localization of 
      spike-related BOLD responses than EEG-EPI. The development of new methods of 
      analysis for this sequence such as modeling of physiological noise, temporal 
      analysis of the BOLD signal and defining appropriate thresholds is required to fully 
      profit from its high temporal resolution.

PG  - 575-85
AB  - The action of non-competitive glutamate receptor antagonists on the effects of sleep 
      deprivation has been studied on Krushinskii-Molodkina rats having an inherited 
      predisposition to audiogenic seizures and Wistar rats deprived to this respond. Two 
      types of glutamate receptor open channels blockers were used: the selective blockers 
      of NMDA-receptors (memantine and IEM-1921) and blockers of mixed type, impacting 
      both on the NMDA- and presumably Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA/kainate receptors (IEM-1754 
      and IEM 1925). Rats were subjected to 12 hours long sleep deprivation. Immediatly 
      after that memantine and IEM-1921 were injected, and during the first 3 hours the 
      total or partial reduction of fast-wave (paradoxical) sleep and a significant 
      increase of the representation of wakefulness at the cost of reducing the total time 
      of slow-wave sleep were observed. These effects are most likely to be a consequence 
      of the blockade of NMDA-receptors functioning in the systems of the rat brain 
      responsible for the launch and maintenance of fast-wave sleep. Injection of IEM-1754 
      and IEM-1925 on background of sleep deprivation did not affect the organization of 
      sleep during the first 3 hours of their action. During the second three-hour period 
      the rebound effect was observed. The obtained results indicate the involvement of 
      NMDA glutamate receptors in the functioning of various parts of the sleep system of 
      both rat lines.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe initial and follow-up electroencephalographic (EEG) 
      characteristics in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis. 
      METHODS: Consecutive polygraphic video-EEG recordings were analyzed in nine 
      pediatric patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis at the initial stage of the disease 
      and during the intermediate period until motor recovery. EEG characteristics in 
      waking and sleep stages as well as EEG correlates of abnormal movements are 
      described. RESULTS: In six patients, [corrected] the waking EEG showed preserved 
      background activity and either focal or unilateral hemispheric slowing. These 
      children had more favorable outcome than the three children with diffuse slowing. 
      Unilateral [corrected] abnormal movements contra-lateral to hemispheric or focal 
      slowing were also indicative of milder severity when compared to generalized 
      abnormal movements and diffuse slowing. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, 
      a decrease in the expected slow waves and unilateral or diffuse theta-alpha band 
      rhythms were observed in six children, not correlated with the outcome, representing 
      a suggestive EEG pattern of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. [corrected]. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      pediatric patients presenting behavioral disorders and abnormal movements, early EEG 
      patterns may be suggestive of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Moreover early 
      electro-clinical presentation contributes to outcome prediction. SIGNIFICANCE: This 
      case series demonstrates that early EEG patterns may be suggestive of anti-NMDAR 
      encephalitis in pediatric patients with behavioral disorders and abnormal movements.

      the assessment of continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS). METHODS: Spikes 
      were searched and averaged automatically from pre- and postoperative EEGs of ten 
      patients with CSWS who underwent corpus callosotomy (eight) or resective epilepsy 
      surgery (two). From the most prominent spike, we measured peak amplitude and root 
      mean square (RMS) over ±150ms window around the peak. In order to compensate for 
      spatiotemporal instability of spikes, the cumulative amplitude and RMS were computed 
      from the highest quartile of electrodes (Ampl-Q and RMS-Q, respectively). The 
      stability of parameters was studied by comparing two ten minute epochs during the 
      first hour of NREM sleep, as well as by analyzing overnight variation of indices in 
      further ten patients with CSWS. The Ampl-Q and RMS-Q were compared between pre- and 
      postoperative recordings. RESULTS: All four measures, amplitude, RMS, Ampl-Q and 
      RMS-Q, were correlated with each other and highly dependent on NREM/REM-sleep stage 
      and arousals. Expectedly, Ampl-Q and RMS-Q had the greatest intra-individual 
      stability. The amplitude had up to 71% intra-individual variation making it 
      unhelpful for clinical use. Ampl-Q and RMS-Q were comparable in assessing change 
      following surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Computing an integrated RMS over multiple 
      electrodes during steady NREM sleep offers a stable and reliable parameter for 
      evaluating the strength of spikes in CSWS. SIGNIFICANCE: Analyzing spike strength 
      with RMS-Q may offer a clinically useful, supplementary index for EEG monitoring of 
      CSWS where spike index has been of limited value.

TI  - Having to stop driving at night because of dangerous sleepiness--awareness, 
      physiology and behaviour.
PG  - 380-8
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12042 [doi]
AB  - A large number of accidents are due to the driver falling asleep at the wheel, but 
      details of this link have not been studied on a real road. The purpose of the 
      present study was to describe the development of sleepiness indicators, leading to 
      the drive being terminated prematurely by the onboard expert driving instructor 
      because of imminent danger. Eighteen individuals participated during a day drive and 
      a night drive on a motorway (both 90 min). Eight drivers terminated (N) prematurely 
      (after 43 min) because of sleep-related imminent danger [according to the driving 
      instructor or their own judgement (two cases)]. The results showed very high 
      sleepiness ratings (8.5 units on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) immediately before 
      termination (<7 at a similar time interval for those 10 who completed the drive). 
      Group N also showed significantly higher levels of sleep intrusions on the 
      electroencephalography/electro-oculography (EEG/EOG) than those who completed the 
      drive (group C). The sleep intrusions were increased in group N during the first 
      40 min of the night drive. During the day drive, sleep intrusions were increased 
      significantly in group N. The night drive showed significant increases of all 
      sleepiness indicators compared to the day drive, but also reduced speed and driving 
      to the left in the lane. It was concluded that 44% of drivers during late-night 
      driving became dangerously sleepy, and that this group showed higher perceived 
      sleepiness and more sleep intrusions in the EEG/EOG.

TI  - [Theta rhythm recorded in the hippocampal formation in vitro].
PG  - 617-30
AB  - Theta rhythm is the best synchronized EEG activity that can be recorded in the 
      mammalian brain. Hippocampal formation (HPC) is considered to be the main structure 
      involved in the generation of this activity. Numerous data indicate that theta 
      rhythm is involved in long-term potentiation, spatial learning, spatial navigation, 
      verbal and spatial working memory, REM sleep, locomotor activities, and 
      sensori-motor integration. Since the discovery of cholinergically-induced theta 
      rhythm recorded from the hippocampal formation slices, central mechanisms underlying 
      theta generation have been successfully studied in the in vitro conditions. Most of 
      in vitro studies have been focused on the basic question regarding the similarities 
      between cholinergically-induced theta oscillations and theta rhythm examined in the 
      in vivo conditions. The results of these experiments have clearly demonstrated that 
      the main properties of theta rhythm in both, in vitro and in vivo preparations are 
      similar. The present review has one main objective: to characterize the basic 
      mechanisms underlying the generation of theta rhythm in the hippocampal formation 
      maintained in vitro.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated whether the reduction in epileptiform activity 
      after treatment with high-dose diazepam in continuous spikes and waves during sleep 
      persists over time. PATIENTS: Patients aged 1 to 21 years with continuous spikes and 
      waves during sleep who received high-dose nocturnal diazepam and who had 
      electroencephalogram follow-up were included. Twenty-nine patients met the inclusion 
      criteria and underwent a total of 48 high-dose diazepam treatment cycles. RESULTS: 
      An overnight reduction of the spike wave percentage of at least 25% (i.e., 75-50%) 
      occurred in 29 cycles (20 patients), and persisted within 6 months in 16 of 29 
      cycles (12 patients), but returned to baseline in three of 29 cycles (three 
      patients). An overnight reduction of at least 50% (i.e., 75-25%) occurred in 15 
      cycles (13 patients), and persisted within 6 months in eight of 15 cycles (eight 
      patients), but returned to baseline in three cycles (three patients). Twenty of 29 
      cycles that responded in the short term had persistent response on follow-up. 
      Thirteen cycles of treatment were associated with mild side effects that did not 
      recur with repeated treatment cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with high-dose diazepam 
      reduced epileptiform activity in continuous spikes and waves during sleep in the 
      short term, and improvement persisted for several months in most cycles. Short-term 
      response predicted persistence of this effect on subsequent follow-up.

TI  - Quantitative evaluation for the wakefulness state using complexity-based decision 
      threshold value in EEG signals.
PG  - 6175-8
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610963 [doi]
AB  - Fully awake state of the subjects tends to be an early drowsy state as a result from 
      the prolonged time of electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. Such situations can 
      complicate the interpretation of EEG signals and hence, the wakefulness of the 
      subject should be considered in the inspection. Thus, in the present study, a new 
      index for quantitative evaluation of the wakefulness (whether either early drowsy or 
      fully awake) state of subjects by using a complexity-based decision threshold value 
      was developed. The proposed index was based on approximate entropy (ApEn) to 
      quantify the complexity metric, but with new parameter values by using a new 
      systematic approach. This index was evaluated using occipital-alpha rhythm during 
      eye closure for 45 healthy adult subjects for each one of two groups: fully awake 
      and drowsy groups. Our index could show more superiority than other conventional 
      spectral-based indices used for evaluating the wakefulness state of subjects 
      including relative delta sub band power (R.δ), relative theta sub band power (R.θ), 
      power ratio between theta and alpha (Pθ/α), and between theta and beta (Pθ/β) over 
      occipital lobe. Our index is superior than R.δ, R.θ, Pθ/α and Pθ/β with 10%, 5.5%, 
      8.9% and 24.4% respectively.

TI  - Effects of remifentanil on processing of auditory stimuli: a combined MEG/EEG study.
PG  - 39-48
LID - 10.1177/0269881113512036 [doi]
AB  - Remifentanil (Ultiva(®)) is a potent ultra-short acting mu-opioid receptor agonist 
      used for perioperative pain treatment and anaesthesia. So far, it is not known how 
      sensitive the cognitive processing of auditory perception elicited by the mismatch 
      negativity (MMN) paradigm is to opioids. The present exploratory study investigated 
      how the opioid remifentanil modulates different stages of auditory processing as 
      reflected in the MMN(m) and P3a(m). We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) during auditory stimulation under remifentanil or 
      placebo infusion in 20 healthy participants. For the MMN, a gender effect was found 
      for tones deviating in frequency (± 10%) from the standard tone. Remifentanil 
      increased the amplitude of the frequency MMN at F3 in females but not in males. No 
      effect of treatment was found for the MMN(m) or the novel P3a(m). These results 
      suggest that while the bottom-up stimulus change detection system for auditory 
      stimuli appears to be relatively insensitive to opioids, the automatic attention 
      switch caused by the change detection seems to be modulated by the opioid system in 
      females. The multiple deviant paradigm including novel sounds is a promising tool 
      for investigating pharmacological manipulation of different stages of auditory 
      processing. Furthermore, combining the two techniques will yield more specific 
      information about the drug effects on MMN(m).

TI  - Improving driver alertness through music selection using a mobile EEG to detect 
      brainwaves.

AB  - Driving safety has become a global topic of discussion with the recent development 
      of the Smart Car concept. Many of the current car safety monitoring systems are 
      based on image discrimination techniques, such as sensing the vehicle drifting from 
      the main road, or changes in the driver's facial expressions. However, these 
      techniques are either too simplistic or have a low success rate as image processing 
      is easily affected by external factors, such as weather and illumination. We 
      developed a drowsiness detection mechanism based on an electroencephalogram (EEG) 
      reading collected from the driver with an off-the-shelf mobile sensor. This sensor 
      employs wireless transmission technology and is suitable for wear by the driver of a 
      vehicle. The following classification techniques were incorporated: Artificial 
      Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, and k Nearest Neighbor. These classifiers 
      were integrated with integration functions after a genetic algorithm was first used 
      to adjust the weighting for each classifier in the integration function. In 
      addition, since past studies have shown effects of music on a person's 
      state-of-mind, we propose a personalized music recommendation mechanism as a part of 
      our system. Through the in-car stereo system, this music recommendation mechanism 
      can help prevent a driver from becoming drowsy due to monotonous road conditions. 
      Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed drowsiness 
      detection method to determine a driver's state of mind, and the music recommendation 
      system is therefore able to reduce drowsiness.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the effects of caffeine and bright light therapy on 
      simulated nighttime driving in sleep-deprived healthy volunteers. PARTICIPANTS AND 
      METHODS: Twelve male healthy volunteers aged 20 to 50 years participated in a 
      randomized cross-over study of simulated nighttime driving at a sleep laboratory, 
      followed by recovery sleep with polysomnography at home. The volunteers received 
      variable combinations of caffeine 200mg (C+), caffeine placebo (C-), bright light 
      10,000 lux (L+), and bright light placebo<50 lux (L-), in four sessions (C+L+, C+L-, 
      C-L+, C-L-), in random order with a wash-out period of 7 days. Treatments were given 
      at 1 a.m. and testing was performed at 1:30 a.m., 3 a.m., 4 a.m., and 6 a.m. Lane 
      drifting was the primary outcome measure. Other measures were reaction times, 
      self-rated fatigue, sleepiness and recovery sleep. RESULTS: Without treatment, lane 
      drifting increased throughout the night, and objective and subjective vigilance 
      declined. Paired comparisons showed that lane drifting was significantly worse at 6 
      a.m. and at 4 a.m. than at 1:30 a.m. There was a global treatment effect on lane 
      drifting. Lane drifting at 6 a.m. was significantly decreased with C+L+ compared to 
      C-L-. CONCLUSIONS: Bright light therapy combined with caffeine administered at 1 
      a.m. decreased lane drifting by healthy volunteers during simulated nighttime 
      driving.

TI  - Congenital hemiparesis, unilateral polymicrogyria and epilepsy with or without 
      status epilepticus during sleep: a study of 66 patients with long-term follow-up.
PG  - 417-27
LID - 10.1684/epd.2013.0612 [doi]
AB  - AIM: We retrospectively analysed the electroclinical features, treatment, and 
      outcome in patients with unilateral polymicrogyria (PMG), focussing on epileptic 
      syndrome with or without encephalopathy, with status epilepticus during sleep (ESES) 
      or continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWS) syndrome. METHODS: From June 
      1990 to December 2012, 39 males and 27 females, aged 5-26 years, were studied. We 
      did not include patients with bilateral PMG or cases with unilateral PMG associated 
      with other cerebral lesions. The mean follow-up period was 12 years (range: 3-22 
      years). RESULTS: Mean age at epilepsy onset was 6.5 years. Focal motor seizures 
      occurred in all cases and 25 had secondary generalised seizures. Six patients also 
      had complex focal seizures. Interictal EEG recordings showed focal spikes in all 
      cases. For 43 of 53 patients with epilepsy, aged 2-9.5 years, the electroclinical 
      features changed. An increase in frequency of focal motor seizures was reported in 
      20 patients, negative myoclonus occurred in 32 patients, atypical absences in 25 
      patients, and positive myoclonus in 19 patients. All patients had a continuous 
      symmetric or asymmetric pattern of spike-wave activity during slow-wave sleep. 
      CONCLUSION: For patients presenting with congenital hemiparesis, negative or 
      positive myoclonus, and absences and focal motor seizures with ESES/CSWS, unilateral 
      PMG should be considered. Brain MRI is mandatory to confirm this cortical 
      malformation. The most commonly used treatments were clobazam, ethosuximide, and 
      sulthiame, alone or in combination. For refractory cases, high-dose steroids were 
      administered and surgery was performed in two patients. Outcome was relatively 
      benign.

AB  - We performed a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of the effects of 
      spike activity during sleep and when awake on learning, long-term memory, vigilance 
      and behavior before and after treatment with levetiracetam in children with 
      electrical status epilepticus during sleep. At baseline, verbal learning declined 
      with increasing spike activity, but there were no relations between spike activity 
      and memory, vigilance or behavior. Levetiracetam was effective in reducing 
      sleep-related spike activity, but on a group level, this had no clear effects on 
      behavior, vigilance or learning and memory. Our results do not allow firm 
      conclusions whether to treat nocturnal epileptiform activity or not; larger samples 
      and longer follow-up may be needed.

AB  - The inferior colliculus (IC) is a mesencephalic auditory nucleus involved in several 
      functions including the analysis of the frequency and intensity of sounds as well as 
      sound localization. In addition to auditory processes, the IC controls the 
      expression of defensive responses. The objective of the present study was to test 
      the hypothesis that the IC contributes to the maintenance of wakefulness. For this 
      purpose, several experimental approaches were performed in urethane-anesthetized 
      guinea pigs. Electrical or chemical stimulation of the IC resulted in 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) desynchronization, theta rhythm in the hippocampus and 
      an increase in heart rate; all of these effects suggest an arousal reaction. 
      Furthermore, by means of extracellular unit recordings, we determined that most IC 
      neurons increased their spontaneous and tone-evoked responses in association with 
      EEG desynchronization. We also studied the effect on sleep and wakefulness of 
      bilateral acute inhibition of the IC by microinjections of muscimol (a GABAA 
      agonist), as well as the effect of bilateral IC lesions in chronically-instrumented 
      (drug-free) guinea pigs. Acute (via muscimol microinjections), but not chronic (via 
      electrolytic lesions) inhibition of the IC decreased wakefulness., We conclude that 
      the IC plays an active role in the maintenance of wakefulness. Further, we propose 
      that this nucleus may mediate arousal responses induced by biologically significant 
      sounds.

      decrease. Studies have shown that generalized seizures and status epilepticus can 
      negatively impact cognition (Dodrill 2004), that children with epilepsy have lower 
      cognitive function on average than children without epilepsy and that children with 
      epilepsy and abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) have lower cognitive function 
      than children with epilepsy and normal EEGs (Bailet et al. 2000). Studies have also 
      indicated that as IEDs decrease, neurocognitive test scores increase (Baglietto et 
      al. 2001). The current study evaluated sleep-activated IEDs in children with the 
      specific syndrome of benign rolandic epilepsy based on the frequency of LEDs in 
      sleep in relation to cognitive test scores. Neuropsychological test scores from the 
      WISC-IV were gathered along with the number of spikes per minute detected in EEG 
      recordings. Statistical analysis revealed a negative correlation between spike 
      frequency and both processing speed and coding scores, though the relationship did 
      not reach statistical significance. This study concludes that there may be 
      correlations between increased spike density and cognitive test scores, or there 
      might be other factors impacting cognition in BRE, but a larger sample is needed to 
      further investigate. In addition, it is possible that a negative result in the 
      present study represents good news, that the number of IEDs in BRE does not harm the 
      brain by negatively impacting cognition.

AB  - Locked-in syndrome (LIS) as a result of brainstem lesions or progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a 
      severe medical condition in which a person is fully conscious but unable to move or 
      talk. LIS can transition into complete locked-in syndrome (CLIS) in which residual 
      abilities to communicate through muscle twitches are entirely lost. It is unknown 
      how CLIS affects circadian rhythm and sleep/wake patterns. Here we report a 
      39-year-old ALS patient who transitioned from LIS to CLIS while brain activity was 
      continuously recorded using electrocorticography (ECoG) over one month. While we 
      found no circadian rhythm in heart rate and body temperature, transition into CLIS 
      was associated with increased fragmentation of slow wave sleep (SWS) across the day. 
      Total time in SWS did not change. SWS fragmentation might reflect progressive 
      circadian system impairment and should be considered as a factor further limiting 
      communication capabilities in these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies suggest that central sympathetic activity might carry 
      information on wakefulness, so we tested the hypothesis that direct activation of 
      the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a well-studied sympathetic vasomotor 
      center, promotes wakefulness. METHODS: A bipolar stimulating electrode was implanted 
      in the right RVLM of Wistar-Kyoto rats or in a brainstem control site. Bioelectrical 
      signals were recorded using a telemetry system. The experiment comprised a baseline 
      session and a 6-h electrical stimulation session (50 μA, 50 Hz for 3 min every 20 
      min). Sleep-wake stages were defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG) and 
      electromyogram (EMG) as active waking (AW), nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and 
      rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Autonomic function was assessed using cardiovascular 
      variability analysis. RESULTS: During the RVLM stimulation session, AW time 
      increased from 38.48±5.82 to 99.91±8.23 min compared with baseline (P<.001), while 
      REM sleep was decreased from 110.10±4.91 to 50.74±13.01 min (P=.004). Analysis of 
      the RVLM stimulation bouts delivered during NREM sleep showed a significantly higher 
      probability of awakening; it also showed that the latency to arousal was 
      significantly shorter than the latency for 10% blood pressure (BP) increase 
      (1.50±0.30 vs 7.42±1.83 s; P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that direct 
      stimulation of the RVLM promotes wakefulness, suggesting that sleep disturbance may 
      result from central sympathetic activation.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a syndrome of unknown etiology that 
      affects 3% to 7% of the population. Although no objective test exists to support the 
      diagnosis, EEG discharges related to the neuropsychiatric abnormalities have a high 
      incidence in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The aim of this study was to 
      elucidate the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of EEG abnormality in 
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Nonrapid eye movement sleep EEGs were 
      evaluated in 134 patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in terms of 
      age, EEG timing, spike and wave index, foci, and seizures. All patients had spike 
      and wave paroxysms that changed with age at and time to first EEG. Only half of the 
      patients had seizures and 46 patients had neither seizures nor foci. Thirty-eight 
      patients had the EEG findings of benign focal epilepsy of childhood. Our data 
      support the view that spike and wave activity evolves in time and that EEG 
      discharges are related to neuropsychiatric symptoms even when a diagnosable seizure 
      disorder is absent.

AB  - This review considers recent evidence showing that cells in the reticular activating 
      system (RAS) exhibit (1) electrical coupling mainly in GABAergic cells, and (2) 
      gamma band activity in virtually all of the cells. Specifically, cells in the 
      mesopontine pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), intralaminar parafascicular nucleus 
      (Pf), and pontine dorsal subcoeruleus nucleus dorsalis (SubCD) (1) show electrical 
      coupling, and (2) all fire in the beta/gamma band range when maximally activated, 
      but no higher. The mechanism behind electrical coupling is important because the 
      stimulant modafinil was shown to increase electrical coupling. We also provide 
      recent findings demonstrating that all cells in the PPN and Pf have high threshold, 
      voltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channels that are essential to gamma band 
      activity. On the other hand, all SubCD, and some PPN, cells manifested 
      sodium-dependent subthreshold oscillations. A novel mechanism for sleep-wake control 
      based on transmitter interactions, electrical coupling, and gamma band activity is 
      described. We speculate that continuous sensory input will modulate coupling and 
      induce gamma band activity in the RAS that could participate in the processes of 
      preconscious awareness, and provide the essential stream of information for the 
      formulation of many of our actions.

AB  - Glossolalia (speaking in tongues) is a religious phenomenon of which there has been 
      only limited scientific investigation. Described here is the case of a 44-year-old 
      woman who had clonic jerking of the left forearm while speaking in tongues. Waking 
      EEG while she was thinking of nothing in particular was normal. After several 
      minutes of silently praying in tongues she manifested right temporal sharp wave 
      discharges and may have been in a state resembling light sleep. Possible 
      relationships between glossolalia, ecstatic religious phenomena, and temporal lobe 
      electrical discharges are discussed.

TI  - Sharp wave-associated synchronized inputs from the piriform cortex activate 
      olfactory tubercle neurons during slow-wave sleep.

AB  - During slow-wave sleep, anterior piriform cortex neurons show highly synchronized 
      discharges that accompany olfactory cortex sharp waves (OC-SPWs). The OC-SPW-related 
      synchronized activity of anterior piriform cortex neurons travel down to the 
      olfactory bulb and is thought to be involved in the reorganization of bulbar 
      neuronal circuitry. However, influences of the OC-SPW-related activity on other 
      regions of the central olfactory system are still unknown. Olfactory tubercle is an 
      area of OC and part of ventral striatum that plays a key role in reward-directed 
      motivational behaviors. In this study, we show that in freely behaving rats, 
      olfactory tubercle receives OC-SPW-associated synchronized inputs during slow-wave 
      sleep. Local field potentials in the olfactory tubercle showed SPW-like activities 
      that were in synchrony with OC-SPWs. Single-unit recordings showed that a 
      subpopulation of olfactory tubercle neurons discharged in synchrony with OC-SPWs. 
      Furthermore, correlation analysis of spike activity of anterior piriform cortex and 
      olfactory tubercle neurons revealed that the discharges of anterior piriform cortex 
      neurons tended to precede those of olfactory tubercle neurons. Current source 
      density analysis in urethane-anesthetized rats indicated that the current sink of 
      the OC-SPW-associated input was located in layer III of the olfactory tubercle. 
      These results indicate that OC-SPW-associated synchronized discharges of piriform 
      cortex neurons travel to the deep layer of the olfactory tubercle and drive 
      discharges of olfactory tubercle neurons. The entrainment of olfactory tubercle 
      neurons in the OC-SPWs suggests that OC-SPWs coordinate reorganization of neuronal 
      circuitry across wide areas of the central olfactory system including olfactory 
      tubercle during slow-wave sleep.

AB  - Central injections of serotonin (5-HT) produce hyperdipsic and hypnogenic behavioral 
      effects that are correlated to decreased Fos-immunorreactivity of 5-HT neurons in 
      free-feeding pigeons. We herein (1) probed the role of 5-HT(1A) receptors on the 
      5-HT- or 8-OH-DPAT-evoked postprandial behaviors and (2) described the sleep-waking 
      states (waking, W; drowsiness, D; slow-wave sleep, SWS; rapid-eye movement sleep, 
      REMS) and sleep architecture of free-feeding pigeons after these treatments. 
      Latency, frequency and duration of feeding, drinking, preening, exploratory and 
      sleep-like behaviors (SLB) were examined after intracerebroventricular (ICV) 
      injections of 5-HT (0, 50 or 150 nmol) or 8-OH-DPAT (DPAT, 0 or 30 nmol) in pigeons 
      pretreated with the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY100635 (WAY, 0, 0.1, 0.3 or 1 nmol). 
      Additionally, the acute (1h) waking-sleep-related electrographic activity in the 
      hippocampus (HP) was examined after ICV injections of 5-HT (150 or 300 nmol) or DPAT 
      (30 or 60 nmol) in pigeons pretreated with WAY (0 or 1 nmol). 5-HT and DPAT acutely 
      increased drinking and then sleep: all doses of WAY attenuated the 5-HT (50 nmol) 
      -induced dipsogenic effect, but left unchanged the effects of the 150 nmol 5-HT 
      dose. The WAY 0.1 nmol dose blocked the SLB induced by the 5-HT 50 nmol dose. Given 
      before the vehicle (VEH) injections, WAY does not affect water or food intake, but 
      increased the SLB duration at all doses. DPAT injections increased feeding, drinking 
      and SLB. All the WAY doses attenuated the DPAT-induced drinking and feeding 
      responses, and the WAY 0.1 and 0.3 nmol doses reduced DPAT-induced SLB. DPAT or 5-HT 
      injections decreased the duration of electrographically-determined waking, increased 
      the durations of D and induced the emergence of SWS and REMS states 
      indistinguishable from the hippocampal EEG associated with spontaneous sleep, as 
      judged from visual and spectral analysis. WAY (1 nmol) increased SWS and D, and 
      potentiated the 5-HT- and DPAT-induced SWS. These data suggest that 5-HT-induced 
      drinking depends on the activation of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors, while 5-HT(1A) 
      autoreceptor activation contributes to the 5-HT-induced sleep. 5-HT-induced drinking 
      and sleep behaviors may thus be provoked by a 5-HT(1A)-evoked, rebound-like 
      reduction in central 5-HTergic activity. These data also indicate that an ongoing, 
      tonic and inhibitory influence of central 5-HT circuits may participate in the 
      control of feeding, drinking and rest behaviors in pigeons during the wake, nibbling 
      diurnal state. These mechanisms appear to be comparable to those found in mammals, 
      suggesting that they may represent a conserved, plesiomorphic functional trait of 
      the amniotes brain.

TI  - Differential spike timing and phase dynamics of reticular thalamic and prefrontal 
      cortical neuronal populations during sleep spindles.
PG  - 18469-80
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2197-13.2013 [doi]
AB  - The 8-15 Hz thalamocortical oscillations known as sleep spindles are a universal 
      feature of mammalian non-REM sleep, during which they are presumed to shape 
      activity-dependent plasticity in neocortical networks. The cortex is hypothesized to 
      contribute to initiation and termination of spindles, but the mechanisms by which it 
      implements these roles are unknown. We used dual-site local field potential and 
      multiple single-unit recordings in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and medial 
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of freely behaving rats at rest to investigate 
      thalamocortical network dynamics during natural sleep spindles. During each spindle 
      epoch, oscillatory activity in mPFC and TRN increased in frequency from onset to 
      offset, accompanied by a consistent phase precession of TRN spike times relative to 
      the cortical oscillation. In mPFC, the firing probability of putative pyramidal 
      cells was highest at spindle initiation and termination times. We thus identified 
      "early" and "late" cell subpopulations and found that they had distinct properties: 
      early cells generally fired in synchrony with TRN spikes, whereas late cells fired 
      in antiphase to TRN activity and also had higher firing rates than early cells. The 
      accelerating and highly structured temporal pattern of thalamocortical network 
      activity over the course of spindles therefore reflects the engagement of distinct 
      subnetworks at specific times across spindle epochs. We propose that early cortical 
      cells serve a synchronizing role in the initiation and propagation of spindle 
      activity, whereas the subsequent recruitment of late cells actively antagonizes the 
      thalamic spindle generator by providing asynchronous feedback.

TI  - Awakening is not a metaphor: the effects of Buddhist meditation practices on basic 
      wakefulness.
PG  - 64-81
LID - 10.1111/nyas.12279 [doi]
AB  - Buddhist meditation practices have become a topic of widespread interest in both 
      science and medicine. Traditional Buddhist formulations describe meditation as a 
      state of relaxed alertness that must guard against both excessive hyperarousal 
      (restlessness) and excessive hypoarousal (drowsiness, sleep). Modern applications of 
      meditation have emphasized the hypoarousing and relaxing effects without as much 
      emphasis on the arousing or alertness-promoting effects. In an attempt to 
      counterbalance the plethora of data demonstrating the relaxing and hypoarousing 
      effects of Buddhist meditation, this interdisciplinary review aims to provide 
      evidence of meditation's arousing or wake-promoting effects by drawing both from 
      Buddhist textual sources and from scientific studies, including subjective, 
      behavioral, and neuroimaging studies during wakefulness, meditation, and sleep. 
      Factors that may influence whether meditation increases or decreases arousal are 
      discussed, with particular emphasis on dose, expertise, and contemplative 
      trajectory. The course of meditative progress suggests a nonlinear multiphasic 
      trajectory, such that early phases that are more effortful may produce more fatigue 
      and sleep propensity, while later stages produce greater wakefulness as a result of 
      neuroplastic changes and more efficient processing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The short acting anesthetic etomidate has been shown to provoke epileptic 
      spikes and rarely seizures. Influence of etomidate on the occurrence of epileptic 
      HFO (high frequency oscillations) however is unknown. An HFO inducing effect of 
      etomidate would allow further validation of the substance as a provocation measure 
      in presurgical evaluation as well as provide insights into the common mechanisms of 
      HFO, spike and seizure generation. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed EEG data 
      from four patients who underwent etomidate activation during invasive video-EEG 
      monitoring with subdural strip electrodes. Spikes were manually selected in raw 
      data, HFO in band pass filtered data (80-250Hz). Rate and spatial distribution of 
      HFO and spikes in three segments were compared: immediately after etomidate 
      administration, as well as during slow wave sleep and while awake. RESULTS: Rates of 
      HFO and spikes increased significantly after etomidate administration: Overall 
      average rates of spikes were 9.7/min during sleep, 10/min while awake and 61.4/min 
      after etomidate. Average HFO rates were 9.5/min during sleep, 8.3/min while awake 
      and 24.4/min after etomidate (p<0.001, non-parametric ANOVA). Spatial distributions 
      of HFO and spikes after administration of etomidate were consistent with the seizure 
      onset zone (SOZ) and area of resection when available (SOZ: two patients; resection: 
      one patient; no information: one patient). Except for spurious events, no additional 
      HFO and spike foci were seen with activation. CONCLUSIONS: Etomidate administration 
      activates spikes and HFO. Spatial distributions do not extend beyond electrodes 
      showing spikes and HFO without Etomidate and seem consistent with the epileptic 
      network. SIGNIFICANCE: Etomidate activation is a safe procedure to provoke not only 
      epileptic spikes but also HFO, which were shown to have a high specificity for the 
      SOZ.

AB  - Sleep encompasses approximately a third of our lifetime, yet its purpose and 
      biological function are not well understood. Without sleep optimal brain functioning 
      such as responsiveness to stimuli, information processing, or learning may be 
      impaired. Such observations suggest that sleep plays a crucial role in organizing or 
      reorganizing neuronal networks of the brain toward states where information 
      processing is optimized. Increasing evidence suggests that cortical neuronal 
      networks operate near a critical state characterized by balanced activity patterns, 
      which supports optimal information processing. However, it remains unknown whether 
      critical dynamics is affected in the course of wake and sleep, which would also 
      impact information processing. Here, we show that signatures of criticality are 
      progressively disturbed during wake and restored by sleep. We demonstrate that the 
      precise power-laws governing the cascading activity of neuronal avalanches and the 
      distribution of phase-lock intervals in human electroencephalographic recordings are 
      increasingly disarranged during sustained wakefulness. These changes are accompanied 
      by a decrease in variability of synchronization. Interpreted in the context of a 
      critical branching process, these seemingly different findings indicate a decline of 
      balanced activity and progressive distance from criticality toward states 
      characterized by an imbalance toward excitation where larger events prevail 
      dynamics. Conversely, sleep restores the critical state resulting in recovered 
      power-law characteristics in activity and variability of synchronization. These 
      findings support the intriguing hypothesis that sleep may be important to reorganize 
      cortical network dynamics to a critical state thereby assuring optimal computational 
      capabilities for the following time awake.

AB  - Two hundreds epileptic patients with nocturnal seizures were studied. The study 
      included evaluation of anamnesis, clinical and neurological examination, routine EEG 
      and/or video-EEG-monitoring, MRI of the brain. The period of observation was 6 
      months - 10 years (on average 3.5 years). Epilepsy started with nocturnal seizures 
      in 48% cases, in 30.5% of patients all seizures persisted during sleep. In 25% 
      patients, nocturnal seizures were different from seizures in awakening. In 18.5% 
      cases, seizures were randomly dispersed in the sleep-wake cycle. Different types of 
      nocturnal nonepileptic seizures were noted in 8.5% cases. The relationship between 
      sleep and epilepsy as well as different types of parasomnias that mimicked epileptic 
      seizures were described and analyzed.

TI  - Insomnia and sleepiness in Parkinson disease: associations with symptoms and 
      comorbidities.
PG  - 1131-7
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.3150 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia and daytime sleepiness are common complaints in Parkinson 
      disease (PD), but the main causes remain unclear. We examined the potential impact 
      of both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD on sleep problems. METHODS: Patients with 
      PD (n = 128) were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth Sleepiness 
      Scale, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Fatigue 
      Severity Scale, Survey of Autonomic Symptoms, and the 39-item Parkinson Disease 
      Questionnaire. A subset of subjects (n = 38, 30%) also completed nocturnal 
      polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). RESULTS: Multivariate 
      stepwise logistic regression models revealed that subjective insomnia was 
      independently associated with depressed mood (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) [1.01-3.19]), autonomic symptoms (1.77 [1.08-2.90]), fatigue (1.19 
      [1.02-1.38]), and age (0.61 [0.39-0.96]). Subjective daytime sleepiness was 
      associated with dosage of dopaminergic medication (1.74 [1.08-2.80]) and fatigue 
      (1.14 [1.02-1.28]). On polysomnography, longer sleep latency correlated with 
      autonomic symptoms (rho = 0.40, p = 0.01) and part I (non-motor symptoms) of the 
      Unified PD Rating Scale (rho = 0.38, p = 0.02). Decreased sleep efficiency 
      correlated with autonomic symptoms (rho = -0.42, p < 0.0001). However, no 
      significant difference emerged on polysomnography and MSLTs between patients with or 
      without insomnia or daytime sleepiness. Higher rates of apneic events did predict 
      shorter sleep latencies on the MSLTs. CONCLUSIONS: Non-motor symptoms appear to be 
      associated with subjective insomnia, whereas fatigue and dopaminergic medication are 
      associated with subjective daytime sleepiness. Objective sleep laboratory data 
      provided little insight into complaints of insomnia and sleepiness, though 
      obstructive sleep apnea predicted worsened sleepiness when measured objectively.

AB  - A subgroup of patients with epilepsy die suddenly and ictal bradycardia (IB) has 
      been implicated. We describe a 63-year-old man with diagnosis of refractory 
      epilepsy. The patient had long video and EEG/ECG recordings (48 hours) of 
      wakefulness and abnormal sleep due to the presence of seven ictal events, which are 
      associated with complex partial seizures that start on the temporal region. The 
      patient presented a severe dysautonomia ictal, at 10-15 seconds of the start of the 
      event is observed bradycardia and after 25 seconds occurs asystole for 15 seconds. 
      Dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted with improvement.

TI  - Change in heart rate variability precedes the occurrence of periodic leg movements 
      during sleep: an observational study.
PG  - 139
LID - 10.1186/1471-2377-13-139 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several reports have described that individual periodic leg movements 
      during sleep (PLMS) activities are associated with autonomic nervous system activity 
      occurring shortly before each PLMS activity. Nevertheless, no study has investigated 
      dynamic changes of autonomic nervous system activity before the onset of PLMS. This 
      study detected changes in heart rate variability (HRV) at the onset of the period 
      with PLMS using complex demodulation method. METHODS: This study enrolled 14 
      patients diagnosed as having idiopathic PLMS disorder (PLMD). In periods with and 
      without PLMS during sleep stage 2, HRV-related variables and the spectral power of 
      fluctuation of a high frequency (HF) band (FHFB) were analyzed and compared. The 
      changes of those parameters during transition from the period without PLMS to that 
      with PLMS were explored. RESULTS: Spectral power in the low frequency (LF) band and 
      very low frequency (VLF) band were higher in the period with PLMS. Additionally, the 
      average frequency in FHFB was higher. The frequency in this band fluctuated during 
      the period with PLMS with remarkable elevation of FHFB. Moreover, spectral powers in 
      FHFB, LF, and VLF were remarkably elevated shortly before the beginning of the 
      period with PLMS (FHFB, -65 s; LF, -53 s; and VLF, -45 s). CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of 
      sympathetic nervous system activity and mean frequency fluctuation in an HF band can 
      occur several tens of seconds before the period with PLMS. Dynamic changes in the 
      autonomic nervous system activity might be related to the vulnerability to PLMS 
      occurrence during the night.

TI  - Glutamatergic signaling from the parabrachial nucleus plays a critical role in 
      hypercapnic arousal.
PG  - 7627-40
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0173-13.2013 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms of arousal from apneas during sleep in patients suffering from 
      obstructive sleep apnea are not well understood. However, we know that respiratory 
      chemosensory pathways converge on the parabrachial nucleus (PB), which sends 
      glutamatergic projections to a variety of forebrain structures critical to arousal, 
      including the basal forebrain, lateral hypothalamus, midline thalamus, and cerebral 
      cortex. We tested the role of glutamatergic signaling in this pathway by developing 
      an animal model for repetitive CO2 arousals (RCAs) and investigating the effect of 
      deleting the gene for the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) from neurons in 
      the PB. We used mice with lox P sequences flanking exon2 of the Vglut2 gene, in 
      which adeno-associated viral vectors containing genes encoding Cre recombinase and 
      green fluorescent protein were microinjected into the PB to permanently and 
      selectively disrupt Vglut2 expression while labeling the affected neurons. We 
      recorded sleep in these mice and then investigated the arousals during RCA. Vglut2 
      deletions that included the external lateral and lateral crescent subdivisions of 
      the lateral PB more than doubled the latency to arousal and resulted in failure to 
      arouse by 30 s in >30% of trials. By contrast, deletions that involved the medial PB 
      subdivision had minimal effects on arousal during hypercapnia but instead increased 
      non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep by ∼43% during the dark period, and increased 
      delta power in the EEG during NREM sleep by ∼50%. Our results suggest that 
      glutamatergic neurons in the lateral PB are necessary for arousals from sleep in 
      response to CO2, while medial PB glutamatergic neurons play an important role in 
      promoting spontaneous waking.

AB  - The research of sleep staging is an important basis of evaluating sleep quality and 
      diagnosing diseases. In order to achieve automatic sleep staging, we proposed a new 
      method which combines with principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector 
      machine (SVM) for automatic sleep staging. Firstly, we used PCA to reduce dimension 
      of time-frequency-space domains and nonlinear dynamical characteristics of sleep EEG 
      from 5 subjects to reduce data redundancy. Secondly, we used 1-a-1 SVM to classify 
      sleep stages. The results showed that the correct rate can reach 89.9%, which was 
      better than those of many other similar studies.

TI  - How does one night of sleep deprivation affect the internal clock?
PG  - 275-83
AB  - Twelve subjects performed two temporal tasks, one explicit (Experiment 1) and one 
      implicit (Experiment 2) after one night of sleep deprivation and after one night of 
      normal rest. Experiment 1 involved a 1100-ms duration production task, and in 
      Experiment 2 subjects performed a word identification task requiring implicit 
      estimation of vowel duration (around 150 ms). One night of sleep deprivation had the 
      same pattern of effect on explicit timing in the suprasecond range and implicit 
      timing in the millisecond range. Specifically, sleep deprivation induced productions 
      of shorter intervals in the duration production task and estimation of segmental 
      durations as being longer in the word identification task. Both results are 
      consistent with an acceleration of pacemaker rate.Moreover, in both experiments, we 
      found a correlation between the alertness level of participants and the size of the 
      effect. Therefore, sleep deprivation, which physiologically manipulates cortical 
      arousal level, produced similar performance modulation in suprasecond explicit and 
      subsecond implicit tasks suggesting a common mechanism.

AB  - The effects of LP-211, a selective serotonin 5-HT7 receptor agonist were studied in 
      adult rats implanted for chronic sleep recordings. Intraperitoneal administration of 
      LP-211 (2.5-10mg/kg) during the light phase of the light-dark cycle significantly 
      increased wakefulness (W) and reduced rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) and the number 
      of REM periods during the 6-h recording period. Direct infusion of LP-211 into the 
      dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) (2-6 mM), locus coeruleus nucleus (LC) (4 mM), basal 
      forebrain (horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca) (HDB) (2 mM) or 
      laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) (4 mM) induced also a decrease of REMS. 
      Additionally, microinjection of the 5-HT7 receptor ligand into the HDB (2 mM) 
      augmented W. Presently, there is no satisfactory explanation for the effect of 5-HT7 
      receptor activation on W and REMS occurrence. Additional studies are required to 
      characterize the neurotransmitter systems responsible for the actions of LP-211 on 
      the behavioral states.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Respiratory events occurring under non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may 
      produce sleep fragmentation. Alternatives to polysomnography (PSG) should be 
      validated for providing simple monitoring tools for patients treated at home with 
      NIV. OBJECTIVES: To study the value of pulse wave amplitude (PWA) reduction as a 
      surrogate marker of cortical micro-arousals associated with respiratory events 
      occurring during NIV. METHODS: 27 PSG tracings under NIV recorded in 9 stable 
      patients with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS), under 3 different ventilator 
      modes (no back-up rate, low or high back-up rate) were analyzed. For all respiratory 
      events (obstructive, central, or mixed event), the association with 
      EEG-micro-arousals, PWA reduction of more than 30% and the presence of associated 
      SpO2 desaturation ≥ 4% was recorded. RESULTS: 2474 respiratory events during NREM 
      sleep were analyzed. 73.6% were associated with an EEG-MA, 91.4% with a ≥ 4% 
      decrease in SpO2, and 74.9% with a significant PWA reduction. Sensitivity of PWA for 
      the detection of an EEG-micro-arousal related to a respiratory event was 89.1% 
      [95%CI: 76.7-95.3]. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 87.0% [95%CI: 75.0-94.0]. 
      Sensitivity of PWA was highest in the S mode, compared to both other S/T modes, p = 
      <0.001. Sensitivity of PWA was also higher for central and mixed events, compared to 
      obstructive respiratory events, p = <0.05. CONCLUSIONS: PWA reduction is a sensitive 
      marker with a high PPV for the detection of EEG-MA associated with respiratory 
      events during NREM sleep in stable OHS patients treated by NIV. In this situation, 
      PWA could be used to improve scoring of hypopneas and allow an appropriate 
      assessment of sleep fragmentation related to respiratory events.

AB  - Sleep electroencephalogram spindles are associated with efficient 
      cortical-subcortical connectivity, and intellectual and learning abilities. In the 
      present study, we assessed healthy preschoolers with a twofold aim: (i) to explore 
      associations of non-rapid eye movement S2 spindles with emotional/behavioural 
      characteristics cross-sectionally; and (ii) longitudinally. A total of 43 children 
      who were 5 years old underwent objective sleep electroencephalogram monitoring in 
      their homes. Emotional and behavioural dimensions were assessed by parents and 
      teachers with the Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire at baseline and at 
      follow-up 1 year later. Non-rapid eye movement S2 spindles were visually scored and 
      compared with Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire dimensions. High non-rapid eye 
      movement S2 spindle density was associated with less internalizing behaviour, more 
      prosocial behaviour and a low total problem score. In girls, high non-rapid eye 
      movement S2 spindle density was related to low hyperactivity, while in boys it was 
      associated with less internalizing behaviour, more externalizing behaviour and more 
      hyperactivity. Longitudinally, a higher number of non-rapid eye movement S2 spindles 
      at 5 years old predicted fewer peer problems 12 months later. In kindergarten 
      children, high non-rapid eye movement S2 spindle density is associated with 
      observable current and future favourable emotional/behavioural patterns. However, 
      gender differences were also found, as should be taken into account in future 
      studies.

TI  - Human cortical excitability increases with time awake.
PG  - 332-8
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhs014 [doi]
AB  - Prolonged wakefulness is associated not only with obvious changes in the way we feel 
      and perform but also with well-known clinical effects, such as increased 
      susceptibility to seizures, to hallucinations, and relief of depressive symptoms. 
      These clinical effects suggest that prolonged wakefulness may be associated with 
      significant changes in the state of cortical circuits. While recent animal 
      experiments have reported a progressive increase of cortical excitability with time 
      awake, no conclusive evidence could be gathered in humans. In this study, we combine 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor 
      cortical excitability in healthy individuals as a function of time awake. We 
      observed that the excitability of the human frontal cortex, measured as the 
      immediate (0-20 ms) EEG reaction to TMS, progressively increases with time awake, 
      from morning to evening and after one night of total sleep deprivation, and that it 
      decreases after recovery sleep. By continuously monitoring vigilance, we also found 
      that this modulation in cortical responsiveness is tonic and not attributable to 
      transient fluctuations of the level of arousal. The present results provide 
      noninvasive electrophysiological evidence that wakefulness is associated with a 
      steady increase in the excitability of human cortical circuits that is rebalanced 
      during sleep.

TI  - Multivariate matching pursuit in optimal Gabor dictionaries: theory and software 
      with interface for EEG/MEG via Svarog.
PG  - 94
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-12-94 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matching pursuit algorithm (MP), especially with recent multivariate 
      extensions, offers unique advantages in analysis of EEG and MEG. METHODS: We propose 
      a novel construction of an optimal Gabor dictionary, based upon the metrics 
      introduced in this paper. We implement this construction in a freely available 
      software for MP decomposition of multivariate time series, with a user friendly 
      interface via the Svarog package (Signal Viewer, Analyzer and Recorder On GPL, 
      http://braintech.pl/svarog), and provide a hands-on introduction to its application 
      to EEG. Finally, we describe numerical and mathematical optimizations used in this 
      implementation. RESULTS: Optimal Gabor dictionaries, based on the metric introduced 
      in this paper, for the first time allowed for a priori assessment of maximum 
      one-step error of the MP algorithm. Variants of multivariate MP, implemented in the 
      accompanying software, are organized according to the mathematical properties of the 
      algorithms, relevant in the light of EEG/MEG analysis. Some of these variants have 
      been successfully applied to both multichannel and multitrial EEG and MEG in 
      previous studies, improving preprocessing for EEG/MEG inverse solutions and 
      parameterization of evoked potentials in single trials; we mention also ongoing work 
      and possible novel applications. CONCLUSIONS: Mathematical results presented in this 
      paper improve our understanding of the basics of the MP algorithm. Simple 
      introduction of its properties and advantages, together with the accompanying stable 
      and user-friendly Open Source software package, pave the way for a widespread and 
      reproducible analysis of multivariate EEG and MEG time series and novel 
      applications, while retaining a high degree of compatibility with the traditional, 
      visual analysis of EEG.

TI  - Arousal from sleep pathways are affected by the prone sleeping position and preterm

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Preterm infants exhibit depressed arousability from sleep when compared 
      with term infants. As the final cortical element of the arousal process may be the 
      most critical for survival, we hypothesized that the increased vulnerability of 
      preterm infants to the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) could be explained by 
      depressed cortical arousal (CA) responses. We evaluated the effects of preterm birth 
      on stimulus-induced arousal processes in both the prone and supine sleeping 
      positions. STUDY DESIGN: 10 healthy preterm infants were studied with daytime 
      polysomnography, in both supine and prone sleeping positions, at 36 weeks 
      gestational age, 2-4 weeks, 2-3 months and 5-6 months post-term corrected age. 
      Sub-cortical activations and cortical arousals (CA) were expressed as proportions of 
      total arousal responses. Preterm data were compared with data from 13 healthy term 
      infants studied at the same corrected ages. RESULTS: In preterm infants increased 
      CAs were observed in the prone position at all ages studied. Compared to term 
      infants, preterm infants had significantly fewer CAs in QS when prone at 2-3 months 
      of age and more CAs when prone at 2-4 weeks in AS. There were no differences in 
      either sleep state when infants slept supine. CONCLUSIONS: Prone sleeping promoted 
      CA responses in healthy preterm infants throughout the first six months of post-term 
      age. We have previously suggested that in term infants enhanced CA represents a 
      critical protection against a potentially harmful situation; we speculate that for 
      preterm-born infants the need for this protection is greater than in term infants.

PG  - e82049
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0082049 [doi]
LID - e82049
AB  - There is growing evidence of the active involvement of sleep in memory 
      consolidation. Besides hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes and sleep spindles, 
      slow oscillations appear to play a key role in the process of sleep-associated 
      memory consolidation. Furthermore, slow oscillation amplitude and spectral power 
      increase during the night after learning declarative and procedural memory tasks. 
      However, it is unresolved whether learning-induced changes specifically alter 
      characteristics of individual slow oscillations, such as the slow oscillation 
      up-state length and amplitude, which are believed to be important for neuronal 
      replay. 24 subjects (12 men) aged between 20 and 30 years participated in a 
      randomized, within-subject, multicenter study. Subjects slept on three occasions for 
      a whole night in the sleep laboratory with full polysomnography. Whereas the first 
      night only served for adaptation purposes, the two remaining nights were preceded by 
      a declarative word-pair task or by a non-learning control task. Slow oscillations 
      were detected in non-rapid eye movement sleep over electrode Fz. Results indicate 
      positive correlations between the length of the up-state as well as the amplitude of 
      both slow oscillation phases and changes in memory performance from pre to post 
      sleep. We speculate that the prolonged slow oscillation up-state length might extend 
      the timeframe for the transfer of initial hippocampal to long-term cortical memory 
      representations, whereas the increase in slow oscillation amplitudes possibly 
      reflects changes in the net synaptic strength of cortical networks.

PG  - 403-10
LID - 10.1097/WNP.0b013e31829dde98 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the nature and propagation of muscle bursts in patients 
      presenting with intensified hypnic jerks and sleep onset insomnia. METHODS: We 
      obtained polymyographic recordings from cranially and spinally innervated muscles 
      during polysomnographic study in 10 subjects presenting with repeated jerking 
      movements at sleep onset, anxiety and sleep onset insomnia. One subject also had 
      daytime polymyography during relaxed wakefulness and drowsiness as well as 
      back-averaging of the EEG preceding the muscle bursts. RESULTS: We observed 4 
      patterns of muscle propagation: synchronous and symmetrical patterned muscle bursts 
      between the two sides and agonist-antagonist muscles similar to those noted in 
      audiogenic startle reflex, reticular reflex myoclonus, dystonic myoclonus, and 
      pyramidal myoclonus with rostrocaudal propagation of muscle bursts. CONCLUSION: 
      Hypnic jerks are physiological phenomena which may be accentuated and repeated and 
      may be of several physiological subtypes.

AB  - Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is an idiopathic focal epileptic 
      syndrome in childhood. It is called "benign" because the seizure and cognitive 
      outcomes are usually favorable, but a significant number of children with BECTS 
      present heterogeneous cognitive deficits correlated to NREM sleep epileptiform 
      discharges. The atypical evolutions of BECTS form a spectrum of conditions 
      suggesting that slow sleep nocturnal interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) 
      specifically determine the neuropsychological deficit. Few follow-up studies of 
      neuropsychological outcome in BECTS are available, and very often, slow sleep has 
      not been recorded throughout night sleep. The present study analyzed the long-term 
      effects of IEDs during NREM sleep on neuropsychological development in children with 
      rolandic spikes. Thirty-three children with a diagnosis of BECTS were monitored for 
      at least two years. Results show that these children are at higher risk for residual 
      verbal difficulties, and the abnormal neuropsychological development is 
      significantly correlated with a greater frequency of NREM sleep discharges, 
      school-age epilepsy onset, and a higher number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The 
      findings are discussed in terms of how slow sleep IEDs affect the consolidation of 
      verbal skills during critical epochs of neuropsychological development.

AB  - In the premature infant, somatosensory and visual stimuli trigger an immature 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern, "delta-brushes," in the corresponding sensory 
      cortical areas. Whether auditory stimuli evoke delta-brushes in the premature 
      auditory cortex has not been reported. Here, responses to auditory stimuli were 
      studied in 46 premature infants without neurologic risk aged 31 to 38 postmenstrual 
      weeks (PMW) during routine EEG recording. Stimuli consisted of either low-volume 
      technogenic "clicks" near the background noise level of the neonatal care unit, or a 
      human voice at conversational sound level. Stimuli were administrated 
      pseudo-randomly during quiet and active sleep. In another protocol, the cortical 
      response to a composite stimulus ("click" and voice) was manually triggered during 
      EEG hypoactive periods of quiet sleep. Cortical responses were analyzed by event 
      detection, power frequency analysis and stimulus locked averaging. Before 34 PMW, 
      both voice and "click" stimuli evoked cortical responses with similar 
      frequency-power topographic characteristics, namely a temporal negative slow-wave 
      and rapid oscillations similar to spontaneous delta-brushes. Responses to composite 
      stimuli also showed a maximal frequency-power increase in temporal areas before 35 
      PMW. From 34 PMW the topography of responses in quiet sleep was different for 
      "click" and voice stimuli: responses to "clicks" became diffuse but responses to 
      voice remained limited to temporal areas. After the age of 35 PMW auditory evoked 
      delta-brushes progressively disappeared and were replaced by a low amplitude 
      response in the same location. Our data show that auditory stimuli mimicking ambient 
      sounds efficiently evoke delta-brushes in temporal areas in the premature infant 
      before 35 PMW. Along with findings in other sensory modalities (visual and 
      somatosensory), these findings suggest that sensory driven delta-brushes represent a 
      ubiquitous feature of the human sensory cortex during fetal stages and provide a 
      potential test of functional cortical maturation during fetal development.

TI  - Night-to-night variability of periodic leg movements during sleep in restless legs 
      syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: comparison between the periodicity 
      index and the PLMS index.
PG  - 293-6
LID - S1389-9457(12)00324-3 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS index) shows 
      high night-to-night variability, requiring multiple nights for its reliable 
      estimation. It is currently not known if this is also the case for the degree of 
      periodicity of leg movements, quantified by the Periodicity index. OBJECTIVE: To 
      compare night-to-night variability of PLMS and Periodicity indices in patients with 
      restless legs syndrome (RLS) or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). METHODS: 
      Eighteen idiopathic RLS patients and 9 PLMD patients were recruited. Subjects 
      underwent two consecutive full night polysomnographic studies. Polysomnographic 
      recordings were scored and leg movement activity analyzed during sleep for the 
      computation of the PLMS and Periodicity indices. RESULTS: In both patient groups, 
      the Periodicity index showed a significantly lower degree of variability than that 
      of PLMS index, being >6.5 times lower in RLS patients and 2 times lower in PLMD 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the use of the Periodicity index in the 
      evaluation of PLMS in RLS and PLMD and indicate that this parameter seems to be more 
      stable than the widely used PLMS index which has higher night-to-night variability.

TI  - Acute effect of carbamazepine on corticothalamic 5-9-Hz and thalamocortical spindle 
      (10-16-Hz) oscillations in the rat.
PG  - 788-99
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12441 [doi]
AB  - A major side effect of carbamazepine (CBZ), a drug used to treat neurological and 
      neuropsychiatric disorders, is drowsiness, a state characterized by increased 
      slow-wave oscillations with the emergence of sleep spindles in the 
      electroencephalogram (EEG). We conducted cortical EEG and thalamic cellular 
      recordings in freely moving or lightly anesthetized rats to explore the impact of 
      CBZ within the intact corticothalamic (CT)-thalamocortical (TC) network, more 
      specifically on CT 5-9-Hz and TC spindle (10-16-Hz) oscillations. Two to three 
      successive 5-9-Hz waves were followed by a spindle in the cortical EEG. A single 
      systemic injection of CBZ (20 mg/kg) induced a significant increase in the power of 
      EEG 5-9-Hz oscillations and spindles. Intracellular recordings of glutamatergic TC 
      neurons revealed 5-9-Hz depolarizing wave-hyperpolarizing wave sequences prolonged 
      by robust, rhythmic spindle-frequency hyperpolarizing waves. This hybrid sequence 
      occurred during a slow hyperpolarizing trough, and was at least 10 times more 
      frequent under the CBZ condition than under the control condition. The 
      hyperpolarizing waves reversed at approximately -70 mV, and became depolarizing when 
      recorded with KCl-filled intracellular micropipettes, indicating that they were 
      GABAA receptor-mediated potentials. In neurons of the GABAergic thalamic reticular 
      nucleus, the principal source of TC GABAergic inputs, CBZ augmented both the number 
      and the duration of sequences of rhythmic spindle-frequency bursts of action 
      potentials. This indicates that these GABAergic neurons are responsible for the 
      generation of at least the spindle-frequency hyperpolarizing waves in TC neurons. In 
      conclusion, CBZ potentiates GABAA receptor-mediated TC spindle oscillations. 
      Furthermore, we propose that CT 5-9-Hz waves can trigger TC spindles.

AB  - A 5-year-old girl exhibited daily episodes of repetitive blinking lasting 5-10 s. 
      Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed marked photoparoxysmal responses (PPR) at 3-20 
      Hz of photic stimulation and diffuse spike-wave bursts during sleep. A 24-h video 
      EEG identified 11 episodes of repetitive blinking, 3 of which resulted in widespread 
      spike-wave discharges. These suggested that the behavior of the patient represented 
      self-induction of PPR. Valproate sodium was ineffective in decreasing PPR, as 
      revealed by EEG, and the frequency of blinking episodes, but clonazepam attenuated 
      PPR and significantly decreased the blinking behavior.

TI  - The caudate: a key node in the neuronal network imbalance of insomnia?
PG  - 610-20
LID - 10.1093/brain/awt329 [doi]
AB  - Insomnia is prevalent, severe and partially heritable. Unfortunately, its neuronal 
      correlates remain enigmatic, hampering the development of mechanistic models and 
      rational treatments. Consistently reported impairments concern fragmented sleep, 
      hyper-arousal and executive dysfunction. Because fronto-striatal networks could well 
      play a role in sleep, arousal regulation and executive functioning, the present 
      series of studies used an executive task to evaluate fronto-striatal functioning in 
      disturbed sleep. Patients with insomnia showed reduced recruitment of the head of 
      the left caudate nucleus during executive functioning, which was not secondary to 
      altered performance or baseline perfusion. Individual differences in caudate 
      recruitment were associated with hyper-arousal severity. Seed-based functional 
      connectivity analysis suggested that attenuated input from a projecting 
      orbitofrontal area with reduced grey matter density contributes to altered caudate 
      recruitment in patients with insomnia. Attenuated caudate recruitment persisted 
      after successful treatment of insomnia, warranting evaluation as a potential 
      vulnerability trait. A similar selective reduction in caudate recruitment could be 
      elicited in participants without sleep complaints by slow-wave sleep fragmentation, 
      providing a model to facilitate investigation of the causes and consequences of 
      insomnia.

AB  - Cholinergic basal forebrain structures are implicated in cortical arousal and 
      regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Cholinergic neurones are innervated by 
      noradrenergic terminals, noradrenaline excites them via alpha-1 receptors and 
      microinjection of noradrenaline into the basal forebrain enhances wakefulness. 
      However, it is not known to what extent the cholinergic versus non-cholinergic basal 
      forebrain projection neurones contribute to the arousing effects of noradrenaline. 
      To elucidate the roles of cholinergic basal forebrain structures we administered 
      methoxamine, an alpha-1-adrenergic agonist into the basal forebrain, in intact 
      animals and again after selective destruction of the basal forebrain cholinergic 
      cells by 192 IgG-saporin. In eight male Han-Wistar rats implanted with 
      electroencephalogram/electromyogram electrodes, a microdialysis probe targeted into 
      the basal forebrain was perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid for 6 h on a 
      baseline day, and with cerebrospinal fluid in the first and with methoxamine in the 
      second 3-h period of the subsequent day. The sleep-wake activity was recorded for 
      24 h on both days. Saporin was then injected into the basal forebrain and 2 weeks 
      later the same experimental schedule (with cerebrospinal fluid and methoxamine) was 
      repeated. In the intact animals, methoxamine exhibited a robust arousing effect and 
      non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep was suppressed. Lesioning of the basal 
      forebrain cholinergic neurones abolished almost completely the NREM 
      sleep-suppressing effect of methoxamine, whereas the REM sleep-suppressing effect 
      remained intact. Thus, the basal forebrain cholinergic neurones mediate, at least in 
      part, cortical arousal and non-REM sleep-suppression, but they are not involved in 
      the REM sleep-suppressing effects of noradrenaline.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify quantitative MEG indices of spontaneous brain activity for 
      fetal neurological maturation in normal pregnancies and examine the effect of fetal 
      state on these indices. METHODS: Spontaneous MEG brain activity was examined in 22 
      low-risk fetal recordings with gestational age (GA) ranging from 30 to 37 weeks. As 
      major quantitative characteristics of spontaneous activity, burst duration (BD) and 
      interburst interval (IBI) were studied in correlation with GA and fetal state. 
      RESULTS: IBI showed a decrease with gestational age (-0.21 s/week, P=0.0031). This 
      trend was only maintained in the quiet-sleep state. With respect to BD, no 
      significant trends were detected with GA and state. CONCLUSION: IBI can be 
      quantified as a fetal brain maturational parameter. The decrease in IBI over 
      gestation was similar to the trend reported in the preterm neonatal EEG studies. 
      Quiet sleep could be the optimal state to study such MEG maturational indices. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: With further investigation, indices extracted from spontaneous fetal 
      brain activity may serve as an early warning for fetal neurological distress.

      wakefulness.
PG  - 337-43
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2444 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) causes phasic inhibition via 
      synaptic GABAA receptors and tonic inhibition via extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. 
      GABA levels in the extracellular space regulate arousal state and cognition by 
      volume transmission via extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. GABAergic transmission in the 
      pontine reticular formation promotes wakefulness. No previous studies have 
      determined whether an agonist at extrasynaptic GABAA receptors administered into the 
      pontine reticular formation alters sleep and wakefulness. Therefore, this study used 
      gaboxadol (THIP; agonist at extrasynaptic GABAA receptors that contain a δ subunit) 
      to test the hypothesis that extrasynaptic GABAA receptors within the pontine 
      reticular formation modulate sleep and wakefulness. DESIGN: Within/between subjects. 
      SETTING: University of Michigan. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Adult male Crl:CD*(SD) 
      (Sprague-Dawley) rats (n = 10). INTERVENTIONS: Microinjection of gaboxadol, the 
      nonsubtype selective GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (positive control), and saline 
      (negative control) into the rostral pontine reticular formation. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      RESULTS: Gaboxadol significantly increased wakefulness and decreased both nonrapid 
      eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep in a concentration-dependent manner. 
      Relative to saline, gaboxadol did not alter electroencephalogram power. 
      Microinjection of muscimol into the pontine reticular formation of the same rats 
      that received gaboxadol increased wakefulness and decreased sleep. CONCLUSION: Tonic 
      inhibition via extrasynaptic GABAA receptors that contain a δ subunit may be one 
      mechanism by which the extracellular pool of endogenous GABA in the rostral pontine 
      reticular formation promotes wakefulness. CITATION: Vanini G; Baghdoyan HA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) on 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in preterm infants (26-34 weeks gestation). 
      METHODS: Two groups were tested in a single, level IV neonatal intensive care unit 
      (NICU; standard care or standard care plus FNI) using a randomized controlled trial 
      design. The intervention consists of sessions designed to achieve mutual calm and 
      promote communication of affect between infants and their mothers throughout the 
      NICU stay. EEG recordings were obtained from 134 infants during sleep at ∼35 and ∼40 
      weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Regional brain activity (power) was computed for 10 
      frequency bands between 1 and 48 Hz in each of 125 electrodes. RESULTS: Near to term 
      age, compared to standard care infants, FNI infants showed robust increases in EEG 
      power in the frontal polar region at frequencies 10 to 48 Hz (20% to 36% with 
      p-values <0.0004). Effects were significant in both quiet and active sleep, 
      regardless of gender, singleton-twin status, gestational age (26-30 or 30-35 weeks) 
      or birth weight (<1500 or >1500 g). CONCLUSION: FNI leads to increased frontal brain 
      activity during sleep, which other investigators find predictive of better 
      neurobehavioral outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: FNI may be a practicable means of improving 
      outcomes in preterm infants.

LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610993 [doi]
AB  - We propose a novel entropy-based measure to quantify the circadian variations of 
      scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) by analyzing waking epochs of nap opportunities 
      under an ultradian sleep-wake cycle (USW) protocol. To compute this circadian 
      measure for a nap opportunity, each waking epoch (~1 sec) is decomposed using 
      wavelet packet transform and the relative energy for the desired frequency band 
      (here, 10-12 Hz) is calculated. Then, in a bootstrapping procedure, a shape 
      statistic (skewness or kurtosis) of the relative energy distribution, after each 
      resampling, is computed. Finally, the probability density function of this statistic 
      is estimated, and the corresponding differential entropy is considered as the 
      circadian measure. This measure was evaluated using EEG recordings from 4 healthy 
      subjects during a 72-h USW procedure. According to the results, the proposed measure 
      showed a significant circadian variation both for individual and group data, with 
      peak values occurring near the core body temperature minimum. The performance of the 
      entropy-based measure was also compared with that of two other measures, namely mean 
      energy logarithm and mean energy ratio, revealing the superiority of this measure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if interictal infraslow activity (ISA), as obtained from a 
      conventional EEG system, can contribute information about the epileptogenic process. 
      METHODS: The entire long-term intracranial monitoring sessions of 12 consecutive 
      patients were evaluated on an XLTEK system for ISA. Three additional patients had 
      long-term scalp recordings. RESULTS: In intracranial as well as scalp recordings, 
      the ISA background was consistently higher in the waking state than during sleep. 
      From this background emerged intermittently focal changes, which could achieve in 
      intracranial recordings millivolt amplitudes, while they remained in the microvolt 
      range in scalp recordings. Although they were mainly contiguous between adjacent 
      channels, this was not necessarily the case and intermittent build-up could be seen 
      distant from the epileptogenic zone or radiographic lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Interictal 
      ISA can be detected in routine intracranial and scalp recordings, without the need 
      for DC amplifiers, and can provide additional information. SIGNIFICANCE: Since ISA 
      is a separate element of the electromagnetic spectrum, apparently non-neuronal in 
      origin, its assessment should be included not only in the pre-surgical evaluation of 
      epilepsy patients but also in patients with other neurologic disorders and normal 
      volunteers.

AB  - The objectives of the study were to examine EEG activities using power spectral 
      analysis (PSA) of good sleepers (GS), psychophysiological (PsyI) and paradoxical 
      (ParI) insomnia sufferers on two consecutive nights. Participants completed three 
      nights of PSG recordings in a sleep laboratory following a clinical evaluation. 
      Participants were 26 PsyI, 20 ParI and 21 GS (mean age=40 years, SD=9.4). All sleep 
      cycles of Nights 2 and 3 were retained for PSA. The absolute and relative activity 
      in frequency bands (0.00 to 125.00 Hz) were computed at multiple frontal, central 
      and parietal sites in REM and NREM sleep. Mixed model ANOVAs were performed with 
      absolute and relative PSA data to assess differences between groups and nights. Over 
      the course of the two nights, more absolute delta activity at F3, C3, and P3 was 
      observed in ParI compared with PsyI suggesting deactivation of the left hemisphere 
      in ParI and/or hyperactivation in PsyI. Further analysis on absolute PSA data 
      revealed that differences between groups relate mostly to NREM. In REM, lower 
      relative activity in slower frequency bands was found in ParI in comparison with GS 
      and less relative theta activity was found in PsyI compared with GS implying higher 
      activation in insomnia. In addition, between nights variability has been found in 
      absolute powers of faster frequency bands (beta to omega). Signs of decreased 
      cortical activity in absolute PSA in NREM combined with increased relative cortical 
      activation in REM were found in ParI which might contribute to the misperception of 
      sleep in ParI.

      children with refractory epilepsy with secondary bilateral synchrony.

AB  - PURPOSE: In epilepsy with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWS), 
      which is a representative epileptic syndrome of secondary bilateral synchrony (SBS), 
      the urgent suppression of this electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormality may be 
      necessary to prevent the progression of neuropsychological impairments. The purpose 
      of this study was to determine the efficacy of levetiracetam (LEV) on SBS, seizure 
      frequency, and neuropsychological impairments in children with refractory epilepsy. 
      METHODS: Eleven (seven male and four female) patients with refractory epilepsy with 
      SBS on EEG, aged between 4.7 years and 11.3 years, were included in this study. 
      After a 3-month baseline period, the patients were given LEV at an initial dose of 
      10mg/kg/day for the first week, followed at increments of 5mg/kg/day every week, up 
      to 20mg/kg/day. The LEV dose was then adjusted up to a maximum of 60mg/kg/day, 
      according to the clinician's judgment. EEG recordings and clinical evaluations were 
      performed every 3 months, focusing on SBS. The occurrence of SBS was then scored, 
      and the relationship between the score and the response to LEV treatment was 
      evaluated. In comparison with the baseline SBS frequency, the EEG response to LEV 
      treatment was classified, and responders were identified as having a ≥50% reduction 
      in SBS frequency. In addition, in comparison with the baseline seizure frequency, 
      response to LEV treatment was classified. Responders were identified as patients 
      with complete cessation (100% seizure control) and a response of ≥50% reduction in 
      seizures. Furthermore, neuropsychological impairments such as hyperactivity, 
      impulsiveness, and inattention were evaluated before and after LEV treatment. 
      RESULTS: Eight patients (72.7%) were considered responders. In addition, all eight 
      patients were also considered responders for clinical seizures. Furthermore, 7 of 8 
      (87.5%) patients with response showed decreased hyperactivity and impulsivity after 
      LEV administration. CONCLUSIONS: The present data clearly indicate the usefulness of 
      LEV in reducing both SBS on EEG and seizure frequency. LEV represents an important 
      addition to the treatments available for refractory childhood epilepsies with SBS on 
      EEG.

AB  - Epilepsy is a common disorder in pediatric neurology, and electroencephalography 
      (EEG) continues to play an important role in its diagnosis. However, the small size 
      of a child's head and immaturity of the brain make EEG interpretation more difficult 
      in children than in adults. This article presents a new method of EEG recording for 
      children younger than 2 years designed to improve recording accuracy in children 
      with small heads. This novel method of EEG recording, in which an increase in 
      distance between recording electrodes is achieved without decreasing the number of 
      electrodes or channels, compares with the traditional 10-20 system in terms of 
      pathologic waves, artifacts, sleep spindles, and wave frequencies. Increased wave 
      amplitude was noted with the new montages in 90 of 105 (85.7%) individuals. The 
      calculation of wave frequency was easier and more reliable in the new montages in 
      comparison with the prevailing recordings. More numerous sleep spindles were 
      detected in 49 of 105 (47.6%) children. The number of detected pathological waves 
      increased in 49 of 105 (47.6%) children on the new montages versus the 10-20 
      electrode system. The incidence of artifact waves in the traces was similar between 
      the two methods in 94 (89.5%) patients and diminished in 11 of 105 (10.5%) patients. 
      These preliminary studies suggest that the new recording system might be a suitable 
      substitute for the routine 10-20 system, especially in young infants and neonates. 
      Further evaluation and multicenter clinical trials will contribute to the 
      reliability of this proposed method.

AB  - Sleep restriction leads to metabolism dysregulation and to weight gain, which is 
      apparently the consequence of an excessive caloric intake. On the other hand, 
      obesity is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness in humans and promotes sleep 
      in different rodent models of obesity. Since no consistent data on the wake-sleep 
      (WS) pattern in diet-induced obesity rats are available, in the present study the 
      effects on the WS cycle of the prolonged delivery of a high-fat hypercaloric (HC) 
      diet leading to obesity were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. The main findings are 
      that animals kept under a HC diet for either four or eight weeks showed an overall 
      decrease of time spent in wakefulness (Wake) and a clear Wake fragmentation when 
      compared to animals kept under a normocaloric diet. The development of obesity was 
      also accompanied with the occurrence of a larger daily amount of REM sleep (REMS). 
      However, the capacity of HC animals to respond to a "Continuous darkness" exposure 
      condition (obtained by extending the Dark period of the Light-Dark cycle to the 
      following Light period) with an increase of Sequential REMS was dampened. The 
      results of the present study indicate that if, on one hand, sleep curtailment 
      promotes an excess of energy accumulation; on the other hand an over-exceeding 
      energy accumulation depresses Wake. Thus, processes underlying energy homeostasis 
      possibly interact with those underlying WS behavior, in order to optimize energy 
      storage.

AB  - The spontaneous brain activity exhibits long-range spatial correlations detected 
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in newborns when (1) long 
      neuronal pathways are still developing, and (2) the electrical brain activity 
      consists of developmentally unique, intermittent events believed to guide 
      activity-dependent brain wiring. We studied this spontaneous electrical brain 
      activity using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) of premature and fullterm 
      babies during sleep to assess the development of spatial integration during last 
      months of gestation. Correlations of frequency-specific amplitudes were found to 
      follow a robust bimodality: During low amplitudes (low mode), brain activity 
      exhibited very weak spatial correlations. In contrast, the developmentally essential 
      high-amplitude events (high mode) showed strong spatial correlations. There were no 
      clear spatial patterns in the early preterm, but clear frontal and parieto-occipital 
      modules at term age. A significant fronto-occipital gradient was also seen in the 
      development of the graph measure clustering coefficient. Strikingly, no bimodality 
      was found in the fMRI recordings of the fullterm babies, suggesting that early EEG 
      activity and fMRI signal reflect different mechanisms of spatial coordination. The 
      results are compatible with the idea that early developing human brain exhibits 
      intermittent long-range spatial connections that likely provide the endogenous 
      guidance for early activity-dependent development of brain networks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether existing noninvasive source localization techniques can 
      provide valid solutions for large extended cortical sources we tested the capability 
      of various methods of EEG source imaging (ESI) and magnetic source imaging (MSI) to 
      localize the large superficial cortical generator of the human K-complex. METHODS: 
      We recently determined the intracranial distribution of the K-complex in a study of 
      6 patients with epilepsy (Clin. Neurophysiol. 121 (2010) 1176). Here we use the 
      simultaneously acquired scalp EEG data to evaluate the validity and reliability of 
      different ESI techniques. MEG recordings were acquired in 3 of the 6 patients, and 
      K-complexes were recorded with high density EEG and MEG in an additional subject 
      without epilepsy. ESI forward models included finite element method and boundary 
      element method (BEM) volume conductors; for MSI, single sphere and BEM models were 
      assessed. Inverse models included equivalent current dipole mapping and distributed 
      current source modeling algorithms. RESULTS: ESI and MSI provided physiologically 
      invalid source solutions in all subjects, incorrectly localizing K-complex 
      generators to deep midline structures. ESI provided consistent localization results 
      across subjects for individual and averaged K-complexes, indicating solutions were 
      not influenced by random noise or choice of model parameters. MEG K-complexes were 
      lower in amplitude relative to baseline than EEG K-complexes, with less consistent 
      localization results even after signal averaging, likely due to MEG-specific signal 
      cancellation and sensitivity to source orientation. Distributed source modeling did 
      not resolve the known problem of excessively deep fitting of single dipole locations 
      for extended cortical sources. CONCLUSIONS: Various noninvasive ESI and MSI 
      techniques tested did not provide localization results for individual or averaged 
      K-complexes that were physiologically meaningful or concordant with source locations 
      indicated by intracranial recordings. Distributed source algorithms, though 
      theoretically more appropriate for localizing extended cortical sources, showed the 
      same propensity as dipole mapping to provide deep midline solutions for an extended 
      superficial cortical source. Further studies are needed to determine appropriate 
      modeling approaches for these large electrographic events. SIGNIFICANCE: Existing 
      noninvasive source localization techniques may not provide valid solutions for large 
      extended cortical sources such as the human K-complex.

TI  - Memory consolidation by replay of stimulus-specific neural activity.
PG  - 19373-83
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0414-13.2013 [doi]
AB  - Memory consolidation transforms initially labile memory traces into more stable 
      representations. One putative mechanism for consolidation is the reactivation of 
      memory traces after their initial encoding during subsequent sleep or waking state. 
      However, it is still unknown whether consolidation of individual memory contents 
      relies on reactivation of stimulus-specific neural representations in humans. 
      Investigating stimulus-specific representations in humans is particularly difficult, 
      but potentially feasible using multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA). 
      Here, we show in healthy human participants that stimulus-specific activation 
      patterns can indeed be identified with MVPA, that these patterns reoccur 
      spontaneously during postlearning resting periods and sleep, and that the frequency 
      of reactivation predicts subsequent memory for individual items. We conducted a 
      paired-associate learning task with items and spatial positions and extracted 
      stimulus-specific activity patterns by MVPA in a simultaneous electroencephalography 
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. As a first step, we 
      investigated the amount of fMRI volumes during rest that resembled either one of the 
      items shown before or one of the items shown as a control after the resting period. 
      Reactivations during both awake resting state and sleep predicted subsequent memory. 
      These data are first evidence that spontaneous reactivation of stimulus-specific 
      activity patterns during resting state can be investigated using MVPA. They show 
      that reactivation occurs in humans and is behaviorally relevant for stabilizing 
      memory traces against interference. They move beyond previous studies because replay 
      was investigated on the level of individual stimuli and because reactivations were 
      not evoked by sensory cues but occurred spontaneously.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether temporal epileptic patients and normal volunteers 
      display similar sleep spindles' cortical generators as determined by electrical 
      source imaging (ESI), and whether such generators overlap in epilepsy patients with 
      the epileptogenic zone identified by ESI. METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects and 
      twelve temporal lobe pharmaco-resistant epileptic patients underwent a 256-channel 
      EEG recording during a daytime nap. Sleep spindles were analyzed off line, 
      distinguishing slow (10-12 Hz) and fast (12-14 Hz) ones, and the final averaged 
      signal was projected onto a MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space to localize 
      cortical generators. The same procedure was performed for averaged epileptic spikes, 
      obtaining their cortical source. Intra- and inter-group statistical analyses were 
      conducted. RESULTS: Multiple, concomitant generators were detected in both 
      populations for slow and fast spindles. Slow spindles in epileptics displayed higher 
      source amplitude in comparison to healthy volunteers (Z=0.001), as well as a 
      preferential localization over the affected temporal cortices (p=0.039). 
      Interestingly, at least one of slow spindles' generators overlapped with the 
      epileptogenic zone. CONCLUSION: Slow spindles, but not fast ones, in temporal 
      epilepsy are mainly generated by the affected temporal lobe. SIGNIFICANCE: These 
      results point to the strict relation between sleep and epilepsy and to the possible 
      cognitive implications of spikes arising from memory-encoding brain structures.

TI  - Biphasic effects of alcohol as a function of circadian phase.
PG  - 137-45
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2318 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess how alcohol affects multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) 
      and subjective measures of stimulation/sedation when alcohol is given at different 
      circadian phases. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven healthy young adults (age 21-26 yr) 
      were studied. DESIGN: Double-blind placebo and alcohol (vodka tonic targeting 0.05 
      g% concentration) beverages were each administered three times during the 20-h 
      forced desynchrony protocol. Sleep latency tests and Biphasic Effects of Alcohol 
      Scale (BAES) were administered on each forced desynchrony day. The outcome variables 
      for this study include sleep onset latency (SOL) and stimulation and sedation value 
      (from the BAES). Each outcome variable was associated with the ascending or 
      descending limb of the breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) curve and assigned a 
      circadian phase within a 90° bin. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: BrAC confirmed targeted 
      maximal levels. Only outcome variables associated with the ascending and descending 
      limb of the alcohol curve were analyzed for this article. Alcohol administered at a 
      circadian time associated with greatest sleepiness showed longer SOL compared with 
      placebo when measured on the ascending limb of the BrAC curve. We also found longer 
      SOL with alcohol on the ascending limb of the BrAC curve in a circadian bin that 
      favors greatest alertness. We observed shorter SOLs on the descending limb of the 
      BrAC curve, but with no circadian phase interaction. The subjective data were 
      partially consistent with the objective data. CONCLUSIONS: The physiologic findings 
      in this study support the biphasic stimulating and sedating properties of alcohol, 
      but limit the effect to specific circadian times.

TI  - [General statistical characteristics of the background firing in cat's cortical 
      neurons during slow-wave sleep].
PG  - 347-61
AB  - Background activity of 62 neurons in cat cerebral cortex was recorded in the state 
      of slow-wave sleep for evaluation of the firing statistics. In according to their 
      statistical characteristics neurons were subdivided in three groups. In the first 
      group deviation from the Poisson process were comparatively small, and revealed as 
      fragments of increased excitability following immediately after the refractory 
      period. Second group demonstrated positive correlation of the neighbouring 
      interspike intervals what was conditioned by the changes of the mean firing rate. In 
      these neurons the number of spikes included into the bursts reduced after random 
      permutation of the interspike intervals. The third group was characterized by the 
      big number of spikes included into the bursts (> 15%), and number of bursts usually 
      dropped down after random permutation. Some neurons of this group had constant 
      interspike intervals within the bursts while in other units these intervals 
      monotonically increased toward the end of the burst. Only limited number of neurons 
      demonstrated maximums of the autocorrelation function corresponded to the frequency 
      of the EEG delta activity.

AB  - Hippocampal theta or rhythmic slow activity (RSA) occurring during exploratory 
      behaviors and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep is a characteristic and 
      well-identifiable oscillatory rhythm in animals. In contrast, controversy surrounds 
      the existence and electrophysiological correlates of this activity in humans. Some 
      argue that the human hippocampal theta occurs in short and phasic bursts. On the 
      contrary, our earlier studies provide evidence that REM-dependent mesiotemporal RSA 
      is continuous like in animals but instead of the theta it falls in the delta 
      frequency range. Here we used a virtual navigation task in 24 epilepsy patients 
      implanted with foramen ovale electrodes. EEG was analyzed for 1-Hz wide frequency 
      bins up to 10 Hz according to four conditions: resting, non-learning 
      route-following, acquisition and recall. We found progressively increasing spectral 
      power in frequency bins up the 4 Hz across these conditions. No spectral power 
      increase relative to resting was revealed within the traditional theta band and 
      above in any of the navigation conditions. Thus the affected frequency bins were 
      below the theta band and were similar to those characterizing REM sleep in our 
      previous studies providing further indication that it is delta rather than theta 
      that should be regarded as a human analog of the animal RSA.

PG  - 745-53
LID - 10.4187/respcare.01456 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the influence of 2 ventilation strategies on the occurrence of 
      central apneas. METHODS: This was a prospective, comparative, crossover study with 
      14 unsedated subjects undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation in the medical 
      ICU of Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur, Montréal, Québec, Canada. The subjects were ventilated 
      alternately in neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and pressure support 
      ventilation (PSV) modes. Inspiratory flow/time and pressure/time waveforms and 
      diaphragmatic electrical activity were used to detect central apneas. Ventilatory 
      variability and breathing pattern were evaluated in both modes. Breathing patterns 
      just before central apneas, and associations between apneas and sleep patterns 
      (electroencephalogram) were studied. RESULTS: Switching from PSV to NAVA did not 
      change mean minute ventilation, tidal volume, or breathing frequency. However, tidal 
      volume variability, defined as the coefficient of variability (standard error/mean), 
      was significantly greater with NAVA than with PSV (17.2 ± 8 vs 10.3 ± 4, P = .045). 
      NAVA induced a greater decrease in central apneas, compared to PSV (to 0 with NAVA 
      vs 10.5 ± 11 with PSV, P = .005). Central apneas during PSV were detected only 
      during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. CONCLUSIONS: NAVA was associated with increased 
      ventilatory variability, compared to constant-level PSV. With NAVA the absence of 
      over-assistance during sleep coincided with absence of central apneas, suggesting 
      that load capacity and/or neuromechanical coupling were improved by NAVA and that 
      this improvement decreased or abolished central apneas.

TI  - Myoclonic epilepsy in infancy: an electroclinical study and long-term follow-up of 
      38 patients.
PG  - 1605-12
LID - 10.1111/epi.12321 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (MEI) is characterized by brief generalized 
      myoclonic seizures associated with generalized spike-wave paroxysms without other 
      seizure types occurring in the first 3 years of life in developmentally normal 
      children. In this study we analyze the electroclinical features, treatment, and 
      outcome of 38 patients with MEI. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted 
      in 38 patients followed at the Neurology Department of the Pediatric Hospital Juan 
      P. Garrahan in Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 1990 and 2012. KEY FINDINGS: A total 
      of 24 boys and 14 girls were identified. The mean and median ages at seizure onset 
      were 16 and 18 months, respectively (range 3-40 months). Ten patients (28.9%) had a 
      family history of epilepsy, and six (15.8%) had a family history of febrile 
      seizures. All patients had several daily brief and isolated myoclonic seizures 
      during wakefulness and predominantly in the first two stages of sleep. Twelve 
      children (31.5%) had reflex myoclonus, triggered by a tactile stimulus in 10 and 
      additionally by noise and light in 2. The remaining two had photosensitive myoclonic 
      jerks. The interictal electroencephalography (EEG) recordings evidenced generalized 
      spike waves, polyspikes, and polyspike-wave paroxysms. The interictal EEG was normal 
      in 12 patients. The abnormalities on the ictal EEG were similar to those on the 
      interictal EEG. Most of the patients responded well to valproic acid. After a mean 
      follow-up of 13.5 years, 24 patients (63%) were without treatment. At the last 
      examination, 32 patients had normal neurologic and neuropsychological evaluations. 
      Two patients (5.2%) had significant cognitive impairment (an IQ of 60 and 63, 
      respectively) despite good seizure control. Four patients (10.4%) had significant 
      learning impairment, two of whom also had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: MEI is a well-defined epileptic syndrome of unknown etiology, but 
      likely of a genetic cause. It is self-limited and pharmacosensitive mainly to 
      valproic acid.

TI  - CAP characteristics differ in patients with arousal parasomnias and frontal and 
      temporal epilepsies.
PG  - 396-402
LID - 10.1097/WNP.0b013e31829dda86 [doi]
AB  - Arousal parasomnias (AP) and frontal and temporal epilepsies consist of pathologic 
      arousals originating in abnormal thalamocortical circuits, reflecting increased 
      sleep instability and arousal oscillations--the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP). In 
      this study, the authors aim to investigate the CAP characteristics in 27 patients 
      with AP, 22 patients with frontal and temporal epilepsies, and age- and 
      gender-matched 20 healthy subjects. The mean CAP sequence and cycle was 
      significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (P < 0.003). The total CAP 
      duration was always higher in the patients with AP than in those with frontal and 
      temporal epilepsies, reaching statistically significant level at the first (P = 
      0.044), second (P = 0.024), third (P = 0.010), and sixth (P < 0.001) sleep cycles. 
      The duration of A1 in descending branch (P = 0.062) and trough phase of sleep cycles 
      (P = 0.038) was longer in the patients with AP. The duration of A2 subtype of CAP in 
      ascending branch (P = 0.039) and the number (P = 0.036) and duration (P = 0.050) of 
      A3 subtype of CAP in descending branch of sleep cycles were higher in the patients 
      with frontal and temporal epilepsies. This difference in CAP parameters might 
      suggest that AP are associated with milder activation in specific brain areas, 
      showing a similar evolution with physiologic homeostatic decrease in sleep 
      synchronization. Frontal and temporal epilepsies, however, is associated with a 
      moderate-to-powerful activation in wider brain networks.

TI  - Ontogeny and control of the heart rate power spectrum in the last third of gestation 
      in fetal sheep.
PG  - 80-8
LID - 10.1113/expphysiol.2013.074567 [doi]
AB  - Power spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability has been proposed to provide 
      a non-invasive estimate of autonomic balance. However, there are few systematic data 
      before birth. We therefore examined developmental changes in the frequency power 
      spectrum at very low (0-0.04 Hz), low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequencies (0.15-0.4 
      Hz), as well as the ratio of low- to high-frequency power (LF/HF), in chronically 
      catheterized, healthy fetal sheep at 0.6 (n = 8), 0.7 (n = 7) and 0.8 gestational 
      age (ga; n = 11). In a second study, 0.8 ga fetuses received either atropine (4.8 mg 
      bolus, then 4.8 mg h(-1) for 30 min, n = 6) or 6-hydroxydopamine (20 mg ml(-1) at 
      2.5 ml h(-1) for 3 h; n = 9). Data were analysed by sleep state, defined by 
      low-voltage-high-frequency (LV) or high-voltage-low-frequency (HV) EEG. Total 
      spectral power increased with gestational age (P < 0.05), while LF/HF decreased from 
      0.6 to 0.7 ga. At 0.8 ga, heart rate and LF/HF were significantly higher during HV 
      than LV sleep (P < 0.05). Consistent with this, although total spectral power was 
      not significantly greater during HV sleep, there was a significant interaction 
      between sleep state and frequency band (P = 0.02). Both atropine (P = 0.05) and 
      6-hydroxydopamine (P < 0.05) were associated with an overall reduction in spectral 
      power but no significant effect on the LF/HF ratio. This study does not support 
      substantial, consistent differences between the frequencies of sympathetic and 
      parasympathetic activity in late-gestation fetal sheep.

AB  - The risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is highest with nocturnal, 
      unattended generalized convulsions, and basic resuscitation may be able to prevent 
      SUDEP. This study investigates an under-mattress device (ElectroMechanical Film - 
      Emfit®) which is triggered by rhythmic motor activity of a specifiable duration, 
      frequency, and intensity using a quasi-piezoelectric material sensitive to changes 
      in mattress pressure. The device was tested during inpatient video-EEG monitoring. 
      Eighteen GTCSs were recorded, 10 out of wakefulness and 8 out of sleep. Sixteen of 
      the 18 seizures (89%) resulted in Emfit® activation with both false negative alarms 
      occurring during wakefulness. On average, the device was activated within 9 s of 
      onset of bilateral clonic motor movements (range: -37 to +39 s) and occurred, on 
      average, 45 s before seizure end (range: 19 to 76 s). Only 21 false alarms were 
      encountered, all occurring during wakefulness (PPV: 43%). The data suggest that the 
      Emfit® detection device has a high predictive value for generalized convulsions, 
      offers caregivers a reliable and early warning to assist the patient during 
      convulsions, and may be a novel way to prevent SUDEP.

AB  - Sleepiness has been identified as one of the most important factors contributing to 
      road crashes. However, almost all work on the detailed changes in behavior and 
      physiology leading up to sleep related crashes has been carried out in driving 
      simulators. It is not clear, however, to what extent simulator results can be 
      generalized to real driving. This study compared real driving with driving in a high 
      fidelity, moving base, driving simulator with respect to driving performance, sleep 
      related physiology (using electroencephalography and electrooculography) and 
      subjective sleepiness during night and day driving for 10 participants. The real 
      road was emulated in the simulator. The results show that the simulator was 
      associated with higher levels of subjective and physiological sleepiness than real 
      driving. However, both for real and simulated driving, the response to night driving 
      appears to be rather similar for subjective sleepiness and sleep physiology. Lateral 
      variability was more responsive to night driving in the simulator, while real 
      driving at night involved a movement to the left in the lane and a reduction of 
      speed, both of which effects were absent in the simulator. It was concluded that the 
      relative validity of simulators is acceptable for many variables, but that in 
      absolute terms simulators cause higher sleepiness levels than real driving. Thus, 
      generalizations from simulators to real driving must be made with great caution.

AB  - A topographical relationship exists between the septotemporal segments of the 
      hippocampus and their entorhinal-neocortical targets, but the physiological 
      organization of activity along the septotemporal axis is poorly understood. We 
      recorded sharp-wave ripple patterns in rats during sleep from the entire 
      septotemporal axis of the CA1 pyramidal layer. Qualitatively similar ripples emerged 
      at all levels. From the local seed, ripples traveled septally or temporally at a 
      speed of ∼0.35 m/s, and the spatial spread depended on ripple magnitude. Ripples 
      propagated smoothly across the septal and intermediate segments of the hippocampus, 
      but ripples in the temporal segment often remained isolated. These findings show 
      that ripples can combine information from the septal and intermediate hippocampus 
      and transfer integrated signals downstream. In contrast, ripples that emerged in the 
      temporal pole broadcast largely independent information to their cortical and 
      subcortical targets.

TI  - Ripple classification helps to localize the seizure-onset zone in neocortical 
      epilepsy.
PG  - 370-6

AB  - PURPOSE: Fast ripples are reported to be highly localizing to the epileptogenic or 
      seizure-onset zone (SOZ) but may not be readily found in neocortical epilepsy, 
      whereas ripples are insufficiently localizing. Herein we classified interictal 
      neocortical ripples by associated characteristics to identify a subtype that may 
      help to localize the SOZ in neocortical epilepsy. We hypothesize that ripples 
      associated with an interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) are more pathologic, 
      since the IED is not a normal physiologic event. METHODS: We studied 35 patients 
      with epilepsy with neocortical epilepsy who underwent invasive 
      electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation by stereotactic EEG (SEEG) or subdural grid 
      electrodes. Interictal fast ripples and ripples were visually marked during 
      slow-wave sleep lasting 10-30 min. Neocortical ripples were classified as type I 
      when superimposed on epileptiform discharges such as paroxysmal fast, spike, or 
      sharp wave, and as type II when independent of epileptiform discharges. KEY 
      FINDINGS: In 21 patients with a defined SOZ, neocortical fast ripples were detected 
      in the SOZ of only four patients. Type I ripples were detected in 14 cases almost 
      exclusively in the SOZ or primary propagation area (PP) and marked the SOZ with 
      higher specificity than interictal spikes. In contrast, type II ripples were not 
      correlated with the SOZ. In 14 patients with two or more presumed SOZs or 
      nonlocalizable onset pattern, type I but not type II ripples also occurred in the 
      SOZs. We found the areas with only type II ripples outside of the SOZ (type II-O 
      ripples) in SEEG that localized to the primary motor cortex and primary visual 
      cortex. SIGNIFICANCE: Neocortical fast ripples and type I ripples are specific 
      markers of the SOZ, whereas type II ripples are not. Type I ripples are found more 
      readily than fast ripples in human neocortical epilepsy. Type II-O ripples may 
      represent spontaneous physiologic ripples in the human neocortex.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Learning difficulties or cognitive impairment has been observed in many 
      patients with epilepsy. Evidence from neurophysiologic and functional neuroimaging 
      suggests that epileptic seizures and/or epileptiform activity can be the dominant 
      factors inhibiting specific brain areas. However, most previous studies were focused 
      on cognitive performance in children. In this study, we analyzed a new cohort of 
      adult patients with frequent interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). METHODS: 
      Data from 67 adult patients with epilepsy were reviewed. Electroencephalography 
      (EEG)-video recording and cognitive testing were performed, and the IED index was 
      estimated as a percentage assigned to one of four categories (<1%, 1-10%, 10-50%, 
      and >50%) during either wakefulness or sleep. Correlations of cognitive test results 
      and clinical characteristics of IED categories were analyzed. The effects of the 
      frequency, duration, location, and sleep-wake cycles of IEDs on cognition 
      (intelligence and memory capacity) were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with an IED 
      index >10% showed impaired performance on the Chinese Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
      Scale (WAIS-RC) and the Chinese Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS). This effect was 
      detected independently from other IED frequencies and other IED-related variables, 
      such as duration, distribution, and location. The impact of waking or sleeping IEDs 
      was of equal importance in contributing to impaired WAIS-RC and WMS performance. 
      CONCLUSION: An IED frequency of more than 10% in both waking and sleeping EEGs is 
      associated with impaired cognitive performance in adult patients. However, whether 
      patients with a high IED frequency but low seizure frequency will benefit from 
      antiepileptic treatment should be examined in future studies.

TI  - Excessive daytime sleepiness and hepatic encephalopathy: it is worth asking.
PG  - 245-8
LID - 10.1007/s11011-012-9360-4 [doi]
AB  - The relationship between hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and the sleep-wake disturbances 
      exhibited by patients with cirrhosis remains debated. The aim of this study was to 
      examine the usefulness of sleep-wake interview within the context of HE assessment. 
      One-hundred-and-six cirrhotic patients were asked three yes/no questions 
      investigating the presence of difficulty falling asleep, night awakenings and 
      daytime sleepiness. All underwent formal HE assessment, quantitative 
      electroencephalography and standardised psychometry. Fifty-eight were monitored for 
      8 ± 6 months in relation to the occurrence of HE. Patients complaining of daytime 
      sleepiness (n = 75, 71 %) had slower EEGs than those who did not report it (relative 
      alpha power: 37 ± 19 vs. 48 ± 17 %, p < 0.05). In addition, daytime sleepiness was 
      associated with the presence of portal-systemic shunt (79 vs. 57 %, p < 0.05) and HE 
      history (72 vs. 45 %, p < 0.05). Finally, the absence of excessive daytime 
      sleepiness had a Negative Predictive Value of 92 % (64-100) in relation to the 
      development of HE during the follow-up period. These data support the 
      appropriateness of adding a yes/no question on the presence of excessive daytime 
      sleepiness to routine assessment of patients with cirrhosis, to help identify those 
      who do not need further, formal HE screening.

AB  - Benzodiazepines have a broad spectrum of clinical applications including sedation, 
      anti-anxiety, and anticonvulsive therapy. At the cellular level, benzodiazepines are 
      allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors; they increase the efficacy of inhibition 
      in neuronal networks by prolonging the duration of inhibitory postsynaptic 
      potentials. This mechanism of action predicts that benzodiazepines reduce the 
      frequency of inhibition-driven network oscillations, consistent with observations 
      from human and animal EEG. However, most of existing data are restricted to 
      frequency bands below ∼30 Hz. Recent data suggest that faster cortical network 
      rhythms are critically involved in several behavioral and cognitive tasks. We 
      therefore analyzed diazepam effects on a large range of cortical network 
      oscillations in freely moving mice, including theta (4-12 Hz), gamma (40-100 Hz) and 
      fast gamma (120-160 Hz) oscillations. We also investigated diazepam effects over the 
      coupling between theta phase and the amplitude fast oscillations. We report that 
      diazepam causes a global slowing of oscillatory activity in all frequency domains. 
      Oscillation power was changed differently for each frequency domain, with 
      characteristic differences between active wakefulness, slow-wave sleep and REM 
      sleep. Cross-frequency coupling strength, in contrast, was mostly unaffected by 
      diazepam. Such state- and frequency-dependent actions of benzodiazepines on cortical 
      network oscillations may be relevant for their specific cognitive effects. They also 
      underline the strong interaction between local network oscillations and global brain 
      states.

TI  - [Diagnostic value of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography in predicting 
      outcome of newborn patients in neonatal intensive care unit].
PG  - 614-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic value of amplitude-integrated 
      electroencephalography (aEEG) in predicting outcome of newborns who were at high 
      risk for central nervous system without severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. 
      METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients at risks for neurological disorders referred 
      to our level-III NICU were prospectively enrolled in the study over a period of 3 
      years. They were classified on the basis of their primary diagnoses including 
      hypoglycemic brain damage, meningoencephalitis, bilirubin encephalopathy, and 
      metabolic disease. Clinical data were collected. Amplitude-integrated and raw EEG 
      tracings were assessed for background pattern, sleep-wake cycling, and epileptiform 
      activity. The neuromotor development of survivors was assessed by using the Infant 
      Neurological International Battery (INFANIB). RESULT: The characteristic of aEEG 
      tracings in 42 infants showed continuous normal voltage (CNV)(n = 15), discontinuous 
      voltage (DC)(n = 9), burst-suppression (BS) BS(+) (n = 6), BS(-)(n = 7), flat (FT, n 
      = 5); mature sleep-wake cycling (SWC, n = 4), immature SWC (n = 14), no SWC (n = 
      24); 30 infants (71.4%) had electrical seizures: single seizure (n = 6); repetitive 
      seizures (n = 7), and status epilepticus (SE) (n = 17).aEEG of 20 infants who had 
      poor outcome showed FT (n = 5), BS(-)/SE (n = 6), BS(-)/ repetitive seizures (n = 1) 
      , BS(+)/SE (n = 1), BS(+)/repetitive seizures (n = 1), DC/SE(n = 6). Chi-square 
      analysis and Spearman rank correlation analysis showed the classification of aEEG 
      background pattern, SWC and comprehensive score (score system was developed by 
      evaluation of the above 3 variables) were correlated with the outcome of these 
      infants at high neurological risks. CONCLUSION: Amplitude-integrated 
      electroencephalography can provide important information of the status of cerebral 
      function in neonates at high neurological risk and help to predict their outcome.

TI  - Modeling resting-state functional networks when the cortex falls asleep: local and 
      global changes.
PG  - 3180-94
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bht176 [doi]
AB  - The transition from wakefulness to sleep represents the most conspicuous change in 
      behavior and the level of consciousness occurring in the healthy brain. It is 
      accompanied by similarly conspicuous changes in neural dynamics, traditionally 
      exemplified by the change from "desynchronized" electroencephalogram activity in 
      wake to globally synchronized slow wave activity of early sleep. However, unit and 
      local field recordings indicate that the transition is more gradual than it might 
      appear: On one hand, local slow waves already appear during wake; on the other hand, 
      slow sleep waves are only rarely global. Studies with functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging also reveal changes in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) between 
      wake and slow wave sleep. However, it remains unclear how resting-state networks may 
      change during this transition period. Here, we employ large-scale modeling of the 
      human cortico-cortical anatomical connectivity to evaluate changes in resting-state 
      FC when the model "falls asleep" due to the progressive decrease in 
      arousal-promoting neuromodulation. When cholinergic neuromodulation is 
      parametrically decreased, local slow waves appear, while the overall organization of 
      resting-state networks does not change. Furthermore, we show that these local slow 
      waves are structured macroscopically in networks that resemble the resting-state 
      networks. In contrast, when the neuromodulator decrease further to very low levels, 
      slow waves become global and resting-state networks merge into a single 
      undifferentiated, broadly synchronized network.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: While visually marking the high frequency oscillations in the stereo-EEG 
      of epileptic patients, we observed a continuous/semicontinuous activity in the 
      ripple band (80-250 Hz), which we defined continuous High Frequency Activity (HFA). 
      We aim to analyze in all brain regions the occurrence and significance of this 
      particular pattern. METHODS: Twenty patients implanted in mesial temporal and 
      neocortical areas were studied. One minute of slow-wave sleep was reviewed. The 
      background was classified as continuous/semicontinuous, irregular, or sporadic based 
      on the duration of the fast oscillations. Each channel was classified as 
      inside/outside the seizure onset zone (SOZ) or a lesion. RESULTS: The 
      continuous/semicontinuous HFA occurred in 54 of the 790 channels analyzed, with a 
      clearly higher prevalence in hippocampus and occipital lobe. No correlation was 
      found with the SOZ or lesions. In the occipital lobe the continuous/semicontinuous 
      HFA was present independently of whether eyes were open or closed. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      describe what appears to be a new physiological High Frequency Activity, independent 
      of epileptogenicity, present almost exclusively in the hippocampus and occipital 
      cortex but independent of the alpha rhythm. SIGNIFICANCE: The continuous HFA may be 
      an intrinsic characteristic of specific brain regions, reflecting a particular type 
      of physiological neuronal activity.

PG  - 676-87
LID - 10.1111/desc.12079 [doi]
AB  - Socioeconomic status (SES) impacts on both structural and functional brain 
      development in childhood, but how early its effects can be demonstrated is unknown. 
      In this study we measured resting baseline EEG activity in the gamma frequency range 
      in awake 6-9-month-olds from areas of East London with high socioeconomic 
      deprivation. Between-subject comparisons of infants from low- and high-income 
      families revealed significantly lower frontal gamma power in infants from low-income 
      homes. Similar power differences were found when comparing infants according to 
      maternal occupation, with lower occupational status groups yielding lower power. 
      Infant sleep, maternal education, length of gestation, and birth weight, as well as 
      smoke exposure and bilingualism, did not explain these differences. Our results show 
      that the effects of socioeconomic disparities on brain activity can already be 
      detected in early infancy, potentially pointing to very early risk for language and 
      attention difficulties. This is the first study to reveal region-selective 
      differences in functional brain development associated with early infancy in 
      low-income families.

TI  - Prolonged wakefulness alters neuronal responsiveness to local electrical stimulation 
      of the neocortex in awake rats.
PG  - 239-50
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12009 [doi]
AB  - Prolonged wakefulness or a lack of sleep lead to cognitive deficits, but little is 
      known about the underlying cellular mechanisms. We recently found that sleep 
      deprivation affects spontaneous neuronal activity in the neocortex of sleeping and 
      awake rats. While it is well known that synaptic responses are modulated by ongoing 
      cortical activity, it remains unclear whether prolonged waking affects 
      responsiveness of cortical neurons to incoming stimuli. By applying local electrical 
      microstimulation to the frontal area of the neocortex, we found that after a 4 h 
      period of waking the initial neuronal response in the contralateral frontal cortex 
      was stronger and more synchronous, and was followed by a more profound inhibition of 
      neuronal spiking as compared with the control condition. These changes in evoked 
      activity suggest increased neuronal excitability and indicate that, after staying 
      awake, cortical neurons become transiently bistable. We propose that some of the 
      detrimental effects of sleep deprivation may be a result of altered neuronal 
      responsiveness to incoming intrinsic and extrinsic inputs.

AB  - Long-term neurophysiological recordings, such as scalp encephalograms (EEG), have 
      been routinely used in studies that aim to characterize dynamic changes in brain 
      activity associated with normal biological processes, such as sleep, but are also 
      becoming increasingly common for clinical evaluation of patients with neurological 
      disorders, such as epilepsy. Analysis of non-stationary recordings from multiple 
      days poses new signal processing challenges, in regard to algorithm efficiency and 
      computational cost, as well as adequate dimensionality data reduction. We compared 
      four approaches for estimating the underlying temporal dynamics of long-term 
      recordings from patients with medically refractory epilepsy: (i) model order 
      selection using the minimum description length principle, (ii) approximate entropy, 
      (iii) mutual information, and (iv) Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). Individual 
      approaches were found to be sensitive only to specific scales of variation. 
      Approximate entropy and mutual information were sensitive to local dynamics, whereas 
      dynamic model order estimation captured only slowly varying dynamics. DFA was 
      sensitive to multiple temporal scales.

AB  - Oscillations and synchrony are often used synonymously. However, oscillatory 
      mechanisms involving both excitation and inhibition can generate non-synchronous yet 
      coordinated firing patterns. Using simultaneous recordings from multiple layers of 
      the entorhinal-hippocampal loop, we found that coactivation of principal cell pairs 
      (synchrony) was lowest during exploration and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, 
      associated with theta oscillations, and highest in slow wave sleep. Individual 
      principal neurons had a wide range of theta phase preference. Thus, while theta 
      oscillations reduce population synchrony, they nevertheless coordinate the phase 
      (temporal) distribution of neurons. As a result, multiple cell assemblies can nest 
      within the period of the theta cycle.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In patients suffering from Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) 
      electrophysiological recordings at bedside could serve as a complimentary and 
      economical tool to improve diagnosis. We utilized a motor observation and 
      imagination paradigm to gain new insights on preserved cognitive processing in DOC. 
      METHODS: EEG brain oscillations were analyzed in 10 VS/UWS (Vegetative 
      State/Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome) patients and 7 MCS (Minimally Conscious 
      State) patients and 21 controls during observation and imagination of a grasping 
      movement and group statistics were conducted. RESULTS: While control subjects showed 
      a typical desynchronization at 8-15Hz during observation of a movement, MCS patients 
      presented an analogue response at 8-10Hz, but exhibited a synchronization at 
      12-15Hz. The VS group did not show a systematic response. Imagery-related activation 
      was only sustained for 1500ms even in control subjects, therefore, limiting 
      conclusions regarding the ability to follow an instruction. Furthermore, a 
      clinically diagnosed VS patient exhibited EEG responses indicative for MCS. 
      CONCLUSION: Results indicate that MCS patients are still able to process an observed 
      motor behavior on a basic sensory and perhaps even pre-motoric level, but seem not 
      to be capable of "mirroring" the movement like healthy participants. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      "Real-world" tasks as presented here carry the potential to identify residual 
      cognitive functioning in DOC patients and may ultimately help to lower misdiagnosis 
      rates.

AB  - Correctly processing rapid sequences of sounds is essential for developmental 
      milestones, such as language acquisition. We investigated the sensitivity of 
      two-month-old infants to violations of a temporal regularity, by recording 
      event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in an auditory oddball paradigm from 36 waking 
      and 40 sleeping infants. Standard tones were presented at a regular 300 ms 
      inter-stimulus interval (ISI). One deviant, otherwise identical to the standard, was 
      preceded by a 100 ms ISI. Two other deviants, presented with the standard ISI, 
      differed from the standard in their spectral makeup. We found significant 
      differences between ERP responses elicited by the standard and each of the deviant 
      sounds. The results suggest that the ability to extract both temporal and spectral 
      regularities from a sound sequence is already functional within the first few months 
      of life. The scalp distribution of all three deviant-stimulus responses was 
      influenced by the infants' state of alertness.

TI  - A neocortical delta rhythm facilitates reciprocal interlaminar interactions via 
      nested theta rhythms.
PG  - 10750-61
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0735-13.2013 [doi]
AB  - Delta oscillations (1-4 Hz) associate with deep sleep and are implicated in memory 
      consolidation and replay of cortical responses elicited during wake states. A potent 
      local generator has been characterized in thalamus, and local generators in 
      neocortex have been suggested. Here we demonstrate that isolated rat neocortex 
      generates delta rhythms in conditions mimicking the neuromodulatory state during 
      deep sleep (low cholinergic and dopaminergic tone). The rhythm originated in an NMDA 
      receptor-driven network of intrinsic bursting (IB) neurons in layer 5, activating a 
      source of GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition. In contrast, regular spiking (RS) 
      neurons in layer 5 generated theta-frequency outputs. In layer 2/3 principal cells, 
      outputs from IB cells associated with IPSPs, whereas those from layer 5 RS neurons 
      related to nested bursts of theta-frequency EPSPs. Both interlaminar spike and field 
      correlations revealed a sequence of events whereby sparse spiking in layer 2/3 was 
      partially reflected back from layer 5 on each delta period. We suggest that these 
      reciprocal, interlaminar interactions may represent a "Helmholtz machine"-like 
      process to control synaptic rescaling during deep sleep.

      memory in aging.
PG  - 357-64
LID - 10.1038/nn.3324 [doi]
AB  - Aging has independently been associated with regional brain atrophy, reduced slow 
      wave activity (SWA) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and impaired 
      long-term retention of episodic memories. However, whether the interaction of these 
      factors represents a neuropatholgical pathway associated with cognitive decline in 
      later life remains unknown. We found that age-related medial prefrontal cortex 
      (mPFC) gray-matter atrophy was associated with reduced NREM SWA in older adults, the 
      extent to which statistically mediated the impairment of overnight sleep-dependent 
      memory retention. Moreover, this memory impairment was further associated with 
      persistent hippocampal activation and reduced task-related hippocampal-prefrontal 
      cortex functional connectivity, potentially representing impoverished 
      hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation. Together, these data support a model 
      in which age-related mPFC atrophy diminishes SWA, the functional consequence of 
      which is impaired long-term memory. Such findings suggest that sleep disruption in 
      the elderly, mediated by structural brain changes, represents a contributing factor 
      to age-related cognitive decline in later life.

AB  - Even in the absence of external stimuli there is ongoing activity in the cerebral 
      cortex as a result of recurrent connectivity. This paper attempts to characterize 
      one aspect of this ongoing activity by examining how the information content carried 
      by specific neurons varies as a function of brain state. We recorded from rats 
      chronically implanted with tetrodes in the primary visual cortex during awake and 
      sleep periods. Electro-encephalogram and spike trains were recorded during 30-min 
      periods, and 2-4 neuronal spikes were isolated per tetrode off-line. All the 
      activity included in the analysis was spontaneous, being recorded from the visual 
      cortex in the absence of visual stimuli. The brain state was determined through a 
      combination of behavior evaluation, electroencephalogram and electromyogram 
      analysis. Information in the spike trains was determined by using Lempel-Ziv 
      Complexity. Complexity was used to estimate the entropy of neural discharges and 
      thus the information content (Amigóet al. Neural Comput., 2004, 16: 717-736). The 
      information content in spike trains (range 4-70 bits s(-1) ) was evaluated during 
      different brain states and particularly during the transition periods. Transitions 
      toward states of deeper sleep coincided with a decrease of information, while 
      transitions to the awake state resulted in an increase in information. Changes in 
      both directions were of the same magnitude, about 30%. Information in spike trains 
      showed a high temporal correlation between neurons, reinforcing the idea of the 
      impact of the brain state in the information content of spike trains.

AB  - Apneic neonatal seizures can present as apparent life-threatening events. We report 
      a newborn with unexplained episodes of apnea associated with cyanosis and 
      desaturation, starting on the first day postpartum. Biochemical tests were normal. 
      Central nervous system infections as well as abnormalities of upper airways and 
      cardiovascular system were excluded. Brain monitoring using amplitude-integrated 
      electroencephalography (aEEG) was inconclusive. Continuous monitoring using video 
      EEG revealed epileptic seizures originating from the left temporal region as the 
      cause of the apneas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a 
      developmental malformation of the left frontal and temporal lobes. The patient 
      became seizure free after treatment with antiepileptic medication. This report 
      illustrates that brain monitoring using amplitude-integrated EEG alone could miss 
      focal neonatal seizures. When clinical suspicion of apneic seizures is high in 
      infants with apparent life threatening events, multichannel polygraphic video-EEG 
      monitoring is indicated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can be life saving.

TI  - Absence of systematic relationships between REMS duration episodes and spectral 
      power Delta and Ultra-Slow bands in contiguous NREMS episodes in healthy humans.
PG  - 162-9
LID - 10.1152/jn.00020.2013 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies in animals and humans have reported correlations between the 
      durations of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) episodes and immediately preceding or 
      subsequent non-REMS (NREMS) episodes. The relationship between these two types of 
      sleep is a crucial component in understanding the regulation and neurophysiology of 
      ultradian alternations that occur during sleep. Although the present study 
      replicated previous studies, we also measured NREMS in terms of spectral power Delta 
      and Ultra-Slow bands in addition to duration in examining correlations. The spectral 
      power Delta band, also known as slow-wave activity, measures sleep quantity and is 
      believed to reflect sleep physiology better than mere episode durations. The 
      Ultra-Slow spectral power band was analyzed in parallel. Healthy human participants 
      of both sexes (n = 26, age range 15-45 yr, n = 12 female) were carefully selected to 
      participate in two consecutive series of home polysomnograms performed after 2 
      nights of habituation to the equipment. In the analyses, REMS episode durations 
      (minutes) were compared with immediately preceding and immediately subsequent NREMS 
      episodes (Delta and Ultra-Slow power) in each sleep cycle. REMS episode duration was 
      more strongly correlated with preceding NREMS episodes than with subsequent NREMS 
      episodes. However, in most cases, no correlations were observed in either direction. 
      One ultradian sleep regulation hypothesis, which is based on stronger correlations 
      between REMS and subsequent NREMS episode durations, holds that the main purpose of 
      REMS is to reactivate NREMS during each sleep cycle. The present results do not 
      support that hypothesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize amplitude-integrated electroencephalo graphic (aEEG) 
      traces in neonates with acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE), explore the value of 
      aEEG in early diagnosis and prediction of neurological outcome of ABE. METHOD: aEEG 
      records of 10 cases with ABE (Oct 2009-Nov 2011) were reviewed to identify neonates 
      with a diagnosis of ABE. Clinical data were collected. The aEEG traces were 
      classified according to background activity (normal, moderate, or severely 
      abnormal), presence of seizures and sleep-wake cycling (SWC). Brainstem auditory 
      evoked potential (BAEP) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were studied. The 
      neuromotor development of survivors with ABE was assessed by using the Infant 
      Neurological International Battery (INFANIB). RESULT: The characteristics of aEEG 
      tracings in these infants with ABE were shown continuous normal voltage (CNV, n = 
      5), discontinuous voltage (DNV, n = 4), discontinuous voltage with burst-suppression 
      (BS)BS+ (n = 1); mature SWC (n = 2), immature SWC (n = 5), no SWC (n = 3); 8 infants 
      (80%) had electrical seizures: single seizure (n = 2); repetitive seizures (n = 2), 
      and status epilepticus (SE) (n = 4). Among the 10 infants with ABE, no infants had 
      normal aEEG, 3 had mildly abnormal aEEG, and 7 had severely abnormal aEEG. Eight 
      infants accepted BAEP test, 2 were mildly abnormal and 6 were severely abnormal. Six 
      infants accepted MRI, 1 was normal and 5 were abnormal. By chi-square analysis and 
      Spearman rank correlation analysis, the results of aEEG classification were 
      correlated with the phase of ABE and the severity of BAEP. These infants were 
      followed up for more than 6 months (range 6 months to 1 year). In 3 infants with 
      mildly abnormal aEEG, 2 were normal and 1 was transit in infanib score at 6 months 
      of age. Of 7 infants with severely abnormal aEEG, 1 died, 3 were abnormal (2 Spastic 
      dyskinesia and 1 hypotonia), 2 were transit in infanib score at 6 months old. 1 lost 
      to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography can provide 
      important information of the status of cerebral function in neonates with ABE and 
      help to predict its neurological outcome.

AB  - We investigated the neurophysiological correlate of altered regional cerebral 
      glucose metabolism observed in children with epileptic encephalopathy with 
      continuous spike-waves during sleep (CSWS) by using a multimodal approach combining 
      time-sensitive magnetic source imaging (MSI) and positron emission tomography with 
      [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET). Six patients (4 boys and 2 girls, age range: 
      4-8 years, 3 patients with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), 3 patients with atypical 
      rolandic epilepsy (ARE)) were investigated by FDG-PET and MSI at the acute phase of 
      CSWS. In all patients, the onset(s) of spike-waves discharges were associated with 
      significant focal hypermetabolism. The propagation of epileptic discharges to other 
      brain areas was associated with focal hypermetabolism (five patients), 
      hypometabolism (one patient) or the absence of any significant metabolic change (one 
      patient). Interestingly, most of the hypometabolic areas were not involved in the 
      epileptic network per se. This study shows that focal hypermetabolism observed at 
      the acute phase of CSWS are related to the onset or propagation sites of spike-wave 
      discharges. Spike-wave discharges propagation can be associated to other types of 
      metabolic changes, suggesting the occurrence of various neurophysiological 
      mechanisms at the cellular level. Most of the hypometabolic areas are not involved 
      in the epileptic network as such and are probably related to a mechanism of remote 
      inhibition. These findings highlight the critical value of combining FDG-PET with 
      time-sensitive functional neuroimaging approaches such as MSI to assess CSWS 
      epileptic network when surgery is considered as a therapeutic approach.

TI  - Detectability of newborn chirp-evoked ABR in the frequency domain at different 
      stimulus rates.
PG  - 698-705
LID - 10.3109/14992027.2013.804634 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present paper reports the results of a study on a group of newborns 
      whose chirp-evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were recorded at different 
      repetition rates. The study was aimed at finding an optimum repetition rate for the 
      chirp stimulus that facilitates a short response detection time in the frequency 
      domain. DESIGN: Chirp-evoked ABR were recorded at six different stimulation rates 
      between 20/s and 100/s. The stimulation level was 35 dB nHL. The mean harmonic 
      related SNR was calculated, and the response detection time and rate were assessed 
      using a detection algorithm. STUDY SAMPLE: A group of 80 sleeping and 27 awake 
      newborns with normal hearing were included. RESULTS: The highest mean 
      harmonic-related SNR in both groups was found at 60/s. The signal-to-noise ratio 
      (SNR) was significantly smaller for the awake newborns. A significantly shorter 
      detection time can be achieved for both newborn groups at 60/s compared to the other 
      rates tested. Response detection in the group of awake newborns profited more from 
      the change to 60/s compared to the sleeping newborns. CONCLUSIONS: It can be 
      expected that with this optimized stimulus paradigm a shorter test time and a higher 
      specificity of the hearing screening can be reached.

AB  - High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) associated with continuous spike-waves during 
      slow-wave sleep (CSWS) are speculated to be linked to the disturbance of higher 
      brain function. We intended to investigate the generative mechanisms of HFOs in CSWS 
      by clarifying the effects of intravenous injection (IV) of diazepam (DZP), an 
      agonist for the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor in the GABAergic 
      interneuron system, in patients who had previously been treated with IV DZP. The 
      subjects were three patients with epilepsy with CSWS. For each patient, EEG data 
      before and after IV DZP were separated into consecutive 5-min sections. 
      Time-frequency power spectral analysis was performed on the spikes of each section, 
      and peak-power and frequency of detected high-frequency spectral spots were compared 
      before and after IV DZP. Spectral spots with peak-frequencies at 85.9-121.1Hz in the 
      ripple band were revealed in all three patients. Although the amplitudes of the 
      spikes largely returned to the baseline levels 20-25min after IV DZP, the recovery 
      of the peak-power levels of HFOs lagged behind that of the spike amplitudes, and the 
      power levels of HFOs were lower than the baseline data within 25min after the 
      injection of DZP. No consistent changes were found regarding the spectral 
      frequencies of HFOs. The dissociation of the effect of IV DZP in terms of recovery 
      when comparing spike-amplitudes and the power of HFOs may correspond to an already 
      suggested difference in the pathophysiological mechanisms that generate the spikes 
      and HFOs.

TI  - The role of delta-modulated high frequency oscillations in seizure state 
      classification.
PG  - 6595-8

AB  - High frequency oscillations (HFOs), which collectively refer to ripples (80-200 Hz) 
      and fast ripples (>200 Hz), have been implicated as key players in epileptogenesis. 
      However, their presence alone is not in and of itself indicative of a pathological 
      brain state. Rather, spatial origins as well as coexistence with other neural 
      rhythms are essential components in defining pathological HFOs. This study 
      investigates how the phase of the delta rhythm (0.5-4 Hz) modulates the amplitude of 
      HFOs during a seizure episode. Seven seizures recorded from three patients 
      presenting with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy were obtained via intracranial 
      electroencephalography (iEEG) from a 64-electrode grid. Delta modulation of the HFO 
      rhythms was found to emerge at seizure onset and termination regardless of the 
      dynamics present within the seizure episode itself. Moreover, the differences 
      between delta modulating the ripple or fast ripple may be due to the sleep stage of 
      the patient when the seizures were being recorded. Further studies exploring how 
      this modulation changes in space across the grid may also highlight additional 
      properties of this phenomenon. Its temporal pattern suggests that it is a potential 
      iEEG-based biomarker for seizure state classification.

TI  - Air leak during CPAP titration as a risk factor for central apnea.
PG  - 1187-91
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.3166 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Emergence of central sleep apnea has been described in the setting of 
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) initiation. The underlying mechanism is 
      unclear; however, we postulate that air leak washing out anatomical dead space is a 
      contributing factor. DESIGN: Data were obtained from 310 patients with obstructive 
      sleep apnea (OSA) who underwent either split-night or full-night CPAP titration 
      during January to July of 2009. The majority (n = 245) underwent titration with a 
      nasal mask. Average total leak and maximum total leak were measured at therapeutic 
      CPAP level. Unintentional leak was calculated by subtracting manufacturer-defined 
      intentional leak from maximum leak. RESULTS: SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: 
      central apnea index (CAI) during titration < 5/hour and ≥ 5/hour. The groups were 
      similar in terms of gender, age, BMI, and AHI. The CAI < 5 group had a median 
      average leak of 45.5 L/min (IQR 20.8 L/min) versus 51.0 L/min (IQR 21.0 L/min) with 
      CAI ≥ 5 (p = 0.056). Maximum leak was 59.5 L/min (IQR 27.0 L/min) with CAI < 5 and 
      75.0 L/min (IQR 27.8 L/min) with CAI ≥ 5 (p = 0.003). In the subset of subjects 
      titrated using a nasal mask, median average leak was 42.0 L/min (IQR 17.0) in the 
      CAI < 5 group and 50.0 L/min (IQR 16.8) in the CAI ≥ 5 group (p = 0.001). In the CAI 
      < 5 group, median maximum leak was 57.0 L/min (IQR 23.0) versus 74.5 L/min (IQR 
      24.3) in the CAI ≥ 5 group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Leak during CPAP titration is 
      associated with the development of acute central apnea; these data may have 
      mechanistic and therapeutic implications for complex apnea. COMMENTARY: A commentary 
      on this article appears in this issue on page 1193.

AB  - Brain responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in task-free 
      experimental contexts are known to depend on psychophysiological states such as 
      sleep, vegetative state and caffeine-induced arousal. Much less is known about how 
      TMS-evoked responses depend on task-irrelevant steady perceptual input. Here, we 
      examined ongoing alpha activity and the mean amplitude of EEG potentials in response 
      to occipitally applied TMS as a function of task-irrelevant visual backgrounds. 
      Responses to TMS were robustly modulated by photographs of natural scenes and 
      man-made environments. These effects began as early as during the N100 and continued 
      for several hundred milliseconds after the stimulation. There was also a more 
      general effect of background along with other stimuli, such as blank backgrounds, 
      sinusoidal gratings and moving dot-patterns. This effect was observable from ongoing 
      alpha activity as well. Based on these results we conclude that different types of 
      steady perceptual input modulate visual cortex reactivity and/or connectivity and it 
      is possible to measure these modulations by combining TMS with 
      electroencephalography.

TI  - Detection of generalized tonic-clonic seizures by a wireless wrist accelerometer: a 
      prospective, multicenter study.
PG  - e58-61
LID - 10.1111/epi.12120 [doi]
AB  - Our objective was to assess the clinical reliability of a wrist-worn, wireless 
      accelerometer sensor for detecting generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). 
      Seventy-three consecutive patients (age 6-68 years; median 37 years) at risk of 
      having GTCS and who were admitted to the long-term video-electroencephalography 
      (EEG) monitoring unit (LTM) were recruited in three centers. The reference standard 
      was considered the seizure time points identified by experienced clinical 
      neurophysiologists, based on the video-EEG recordings and blinded to the 
      accelerometer sensor data. Seizure time points detected real-time by the sensor were 
      compared with the reference standard. Patients were monitored for 17-171 h (mean 
      66.8; total 4,878). Thirty-nine GTCS were recorded in 20 patients. The device 
      detected 35 seizures (89.7%). In 16 patients all seizures were detected. In three 
      patients more than two thirds of the seizures were detected. The mean of the 
      sensitivity calculated for each patient was 91%. The mean detection latency measured 
      from the start of the focal seizure preceding the secondarily GTCS was 55 s (95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 38-73 s). The rate of false alarms was 0.2/day. Our results 
      suggest that the wireless wrist accelerometer sensor detects GTCS with high 
      sensitivity and specificity. Patients with GTCS have an increased risk for injuries 
      related to seizures and for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and many 
      nocturnal seizures remain undetected in unattended patients. A portable automatic 
      seizure detection device will be an important tool for helping these patients.

TI  - [Application of amplitutude integrated electroencephalography for early diagnosis of 
      brain injury in premature infants].
PG  - 280-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of amplitude integrated 
      electroencephalography (aEEG) in preterm infants with brain injury. METHODS: This 
      study included 62 cerebral damage infants with 28-36 weeks gestational age (GA), and 
      another 51 normal infants in control group, aEEG recording was performed to each 
      infant during the first 48 h of life, the duration of each recording was at least 2 
      h. The features of aEEG, such as continuity(Co), sleep-wake cycling (Cy) and 
      amplitude of the lower border (LB), were evaluated by semiquantitative analysis and 
      compared between the two groups. RESULTS: All the aEEG features were found having 
      significantly lower values in brain injuries group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression 
      of aEEG features to the presence of brain injury revealed that only Cy was 
      significantly correlated to the outcome (OR = 0.217, P < 0.05). ROC curve 
      demonstrated Cy of the best sensitivity and specificity with 0.769 AUC. Co, LB 
      yielded 0.677, 0.602 AUC respectively. Correlation analysis of GA to Co, Cy, LB and 
      total score showed significantly correlated, the correlation coefficient for Co, Cy, 
      LB and total scores were 0.546, 0.488, 0.536, 0.588 respectively (P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: The Cy in the initial aEEG is predictive for brain injury in premature 
      infants with 28-36 weeks GA. The older the GA at birth, the more mature the aEEG 
      pattern in premature neonates.

AB  - Place cell firing patterns in the rat hippocampus are often organized as sequences. 
      Sequences falling within cycles of the theta (6-10 Hz) local field potential (LFP) 
      oscillation represent segments of ongoing behavioral trajectories. Sequences 
      expressed during sharp wave ripple (SWR) complexes represent spatial trajectories 
      through the environment, in both the same direction as actual trajectories (forward 
      sequences) and in an ordering opposite that of behavior (backward sequences). 
      Although hippocampal sequences could fulfill unique functional roles depending on 
      the direction of the sequence and the animal's state when the sequence occurs, 
      quantitative comparisons of sequence direction across behavioral and physiological 
      states within the same experiment, employing consistent methodology, are lacking. 
      Here, we used cross-correlation and Bayesian decoding to measure the direction of 
      hippocampal sequences in rats during active behavior, awake rest and slow-wave 
      sleep. During pretask sleep, few sequences were detected in either direction. 
      Sequences within theta cycles during active behavior were overwhelmingly forward. 
      Sequences during quiescent moments of behavior were both forward and backward, in 
      equal proportion. During postbehavior sleep, sequences were again expressed in both 
      directions, but significantly more forward than backward sequences were detected. 
      The shift in the balance of sequence direction could reflect changing functional 
      demands on the hippocampal network across behavioral and physiological states.

AB  - Local field potential (LFP) slow oscillation (<1Hz) is typically observed in the 
      cortex during sleep or while under anesthesia and reflects synchronous 
      activation/inactivation of the cortical neuron population. The oscillation can be 
      entrained to repeated external sensory stimuli. To better understand the neural 
      mechanism underlying slow-oscillation generation and its entrainment to external 
      stimuli, we delivered optical stimulation to the cortex of anesthetized rats that 
      exogenously expressed the light-sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) 
      and simultaneously monitored LFPs across cortical layers. We found that the LFPs 
      could be effectively entrained to repeated optical stimulation at 1Hz in deep 
      layers. A stimulus-triggered current-source density (CSD) analysis showed that the 
      evoked oscillation had the same depth and temporal profile as the slow oscillations, 
      indicating that both oscillations have the same neural mechanism. Optical 
      stimulation primarily induced the transition from the cortical up to down state. 
      These results suggest that the anesthetized rat cortex has an intrinsic mechanism 
      that leads to oscillation near 1Hz; effective entrainment to the 1Hz stimulation 
      reflects the resonated state of the cortex to that stimulus. Our study is the first 
      to demonstrate optogenetic manipulation of cortical slow oscillation and provides a 
      mechanistic explanation for slow-oscillation entrainment.

AB  - Slow oscillations are a hallmark of slow wave sleep. They provide a temporal 
      framework for a variety of phasic events to occur and interact during sleep, 
      including the expression of high-frequency oscillations and the discharge of neurons 
      across the entire brain. Evidence shows that the emergence of distinct 
      high-frequency oscillations during slow oscillations facilitates the communication 
      among brain regions whose activity was correlated during the preceding waking 
      period. While the frequencies of oscillations involved in such interactions have 
      been identified, their dynamics and the correlations between them require further 
      investigation. Here we analyzed the structure and dynamics of these signals in 
      anesthetized rats. We show that spindles and gamma oscillations coexist but have 
      distinct temporal dynamics across the slow oscillation cycle. Furthermore, we 
      observed that spindles and gamma are functionally coupled to the slow oscillations 
      and between each other. Following the activation of ascending pathways from the 
      brainstem by means of a carbachol injection in the pedunculopontine nucleus, we were 
      able to modify the gain in the gamma oscillations that are independent of the 
      spindles while the spindle amplitude was reduced. Furthermore, carbachol produced a 
      decoupling of the gamma oscillations that are dependent on the spindles but with no 
      effect on their amplitude. None of the changes in the high-frequency oscillations 
      affected the onset or shape of the slow oscillations, suggesting that slow 
      oscillations occur independently of the phasic events that coexist with them. Our 
      results provide novel insights into the regulation, dynamics and homeostasis of 
      cortical slow oscillations.

AB  - While prenatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure is a well-known risk 
      factor for sudden infant death syndrome, the effect of postnatal ETS exposure is 
      less clear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of postnatal 
      ETS exposure on non-nutritive swallowing (NNS) and NNS-breathing coordination, which 
      are crucial to prevent aspiration related-cardiorespiratory events. Eighteen newborn 
      lambs (6 per group) were randomly exposed to either 10 cigarettes/day, 20 
      cigarettes/day or room air for 15 days. Lambs were instrumented for recording states 
      of alertness, swallowing, electrocardiogram and breathing; recordings were performed 
      in non-sedated lambs at the end of ETS exposure. Urinary cotinine/creatinine ratio 
      confirmed relevant real-life exposure. Postnatal ETS exposure had no effect on NNS 
      frequency but tended to decrease inspiratory NNS (p=0.07) during quiet sleep. No 
      effect on respiratory or heart rate (p>0.6), apnea index (p=0.2) or sleep states 
      (p=0.3) was observed. In conclusion, postnatal ETS exposure in lambs had only mild 
      effects on NNS-breathing coordination.

AB  - Light has an acute effect on neuroendocrine responses, performance, and alertness. 
      Most studies to date have linked the alerting effects of light to its ability to 
      suppress melatonin, which is maximally sensitive to short-wavelength light. Recent 
      studies, however, have shown alerting effects of white or narrowband 
      short-wavelength lights during daytime, when melatonin levels are low. While the use 
      of light at night to promote alertness is well understood, it is important to 
      develop an understanding of how light impacts alertness during the daytime, 
      especially during the post-lunch hours. The aim of the current study was to 
      investigate how 48-minute exposures to short-wavelength (blue) light (40 lux, 18.9 
      microWatts/cm(2) λ(max) = 470 nanometers [nm]) or long-wavelength (red) light (40 
      lux, 18.9 microWatts/cm(2) λ(max) = 630 nm) close to the post-lunch dip hours affect 
      electroencephalogram measures in participants with regular sleep schedules. Power in 
      the alpha, alpha theta, and theta ranges was significantly lower (p<0.05) after 
      participants were exposed to red light than after they remained in darkness. 
      Exposure to blue light reduced alpha and alpha theta power compared to darkness, but 
      these differences did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05). The present 
      results extend those performed during the nighttime, and demonstrate that light can 
      be used to increase alertness in the afternoon, close to the post-lunch dip hours. 
      These results also suggest that acute melatonin suppression is not needed to elicit 
      an alerting effect in humans.

TI  - Steal induction in preschool children: is melatonin as good as clonidine? A 
      prospective, randomized study.
PG  - 328-33
LID - 10.1111/pan.12105 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/AIMS: To investigate whether melatonin would be an alternative drug to 
      clonidine for performance of steal induction. BACKGROUND: Distress during induction 
      might have a negative impact on postoperative behavior. A steal induction is a 
      technique for smooth anesthesia induction, and clonidine has been the primary agent 
      for this purpose. There are conflicting results regarding the efficacy of melatonin 
      for premedication, but its sleep inducing properties have been shown in children. 
      METHODS: Pediatric patients ASA I and II were randomly assigned to receive either 
      melatonin 0.3 mg·kg(-1) or clonidine 4 μg·kg(-1) orally. Primary outcome was the 
      percentage of successful steal induction, while secondary outcomes were onset of 
      sleep, overall quality of mask induction, and adverse events at emergence from 
      anesthesia. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients were included for analysis with a median 
      age of 33 months (range, 12-71) and median weight of 14 kg (range, 8-26). A 
      successful steal induction was performed in 88.4% of group C and 75% of group M 
      (P > 0.05). Onset of sleep in these patients occurred after a median time of 45 min 
      (range 10-60) in group C and 35 min (range 15-60) in group M (P > 0.05). Children 
      not falling asleep after melatonin received the premedication at a significantly 
      earlier time point compared to those falling asleep (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Melatonin was effective for steal induction in 75% of children compared to 88% of 
      children who had clonidine. Melatonin resulted less effective when administered 
      early in the morning.

TI  - Efficiency of a "small-world" brain network depends on consciousness level: a 
      resting-state FMRI study.

AB  - It has been revealed that spontaneous coherent brain activity during rest, measured 
      by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), self-organizes a "small-world" 
      network by which the human brain could sustain higher communication efficiency 
      across global brain regions with lower energy consumption. However, the 
      state-dependent dynamics of the network, especially the dependency on the conscious 
      state, remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted simultaneous 
      electroencephalographic recording with resting-state fMRI to explore whether 
      functional network organization reflects differences in the conscious state between 
      an awake state and stage 1 sleep. We then evaluated whole-brain functional network 
      properties with fine spatial resolution (3781 regions of interest) using graph 
      theoretical analysis. We found that the efficiency of the functional network 
      evaluated by path length decreased not only at the global level, but also in several 
      specific regions depending on the conscious state. Furthermore, almost two-thirds of 
      nodes that showed a significant decrease in nodal efficiency during stage 1 sleep 
      were categorized as the default-mode network. These results suggest that brain 
      functional network organizations are dynamically optimized for a higher level of 
      information integration in the fully conscious awake state, and that the 
      default-mode network plays a pivotal role in information integration for maintaining 
      conscious awareness.

AB  - The neocortical slow oscillation (SO; ~1Hz) of non-REM sleep and anesthesia reflects 
      synchronized network activity composed of alternating active and silent (ON/OFF) 
      phases at the local network and cellular level. The SO itself shows self-organized 
      spatiotemporal dynamics as it appears to originate at unique foci on each cycle and 
      then propagates across the cortical surface. During sleep, this rhythm is relevant 
      for neuroplastic processes mediating memory consolidation especially since its 
      enhancement by slow, rhythmic electrical fields improves subsequent recall. However, 
      the neurobiological mechanism by which spontaneous or enhanced SO activity might 
      operate on memory traces is unknown. Here we show a series of original results, 
      using cycle to cycle tracking across multiple neocortical sites in urethane 
      anesthetized rats: The spontaneous spatiotemporal dynamics of the SO are complex, 
      showing interfering propagation patterns in the anterior-to-posterior plane. These 
      patterns compete for expression and tend to alternate following phase resets that 
      take place during the silent OFF phase of the SO. Applying sinusoidal electrical 
      field stimulation to the anterior pole of the cerebral cortex progressively 
      entrained local field, gamma, and multi-unit activity at all sites, while disrupting 
      the coordination of endogenous SO activity. Field stimulation also biased 
      propagation in the anterior-to-posterior direction and more notably, enhanced the 
      long-range gamma synchrony between cortical regions. These results are the first to 
      show that changes to slow wave dynamics cause enhancements in high frequency 
      cortico-cortical communication and provide mechanistic clues into how the SO is 
      relevant for sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

TI  - The synchronous activity of lateral habenular neurons is essential for regulating 
      hippocampal theta oscillation.
PG  - 8909-21
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4369-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - Lateral habenula (LHb) has attracted growing interest as a regulator of serotonergic 
      and dopaminergic neurons in the CNS. However, it remains unclear how the LHb 
      modulates brain states in animals. To identify the neural substrates that are under 
      the influence of LHb regulation, we examined the effects of rat LHb lesions on the 
      hippocampal oscillatory activity associated with the transition of brain states. Our 
      results showed that the LHb lesion shortened the theta activity duration both in 
      anesthetized and sleeping rats. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect of LHb lesion on 
      theta maintenance depended upon an intact serotonergic median raphe, suggesting that 
      LHb activity plays an essential role in maintaining hippocampal theta oscillation 
      via the serotonergic raphe. Multiunit recording of sleeping rats further revealed 
      that firing of LHb neurons showed significant phase-locking activity at each theta 
      oscillation cycle in the hippocampus. LHb neurons showing activity that was 
      coordinated with that of the hippocampal theta were localized in the medial LHb 
      division, which receives afferents from the diagonal band of Broca (DBB), a 
      pacemaker region for the hippocampal theta oscillation. Thus, our findings indicate 
      that the DBB may pace not only the hippocampus, but also the LHb, during rapid eye 
      movement sleep. Since serotonin is known to negatively regulate theta oscillation in 
      the hippocampus, phase-locking activity of the LHb neurons may act, under the 
      influence of the DBB, to maintain the hippocampal theta oscillation by modulating 
      the activity of serotonergic neurons.

AB  - Early-onset epileptic encephalopathies include various diseases such as 
      early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression burst. We experimentally 
      investigated the unique clinicopathological features of a 28-month-old girl with 
      early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Her initial symptom was intractable epilepsy 
      with a suppression-burst pattern of electroencephalography (EEG) from 7 days of age. 
      The suppression-burst pattern was novel, appearing during sleep, but disappearing 
      upon waking and after becoming 2 months old. The EEG showed multifocal spikes and 
      altered with age. Her seizures demonstrated various clinical features and continued 
      until death. She did not show any developmental features, including no social 
      smiling or head control. Head MRI revealed progressive atrophy of the cerebral 
      cortex and white matter after 1 month of age. (123)IMZ-SPECT demonstrated 
      hypo-perfusion of the cerebral cortex, but normo-perfusion of the diencephalon and 
      cerebellum. Such imaging information indicated GABA-A receptor dysfunction of the 
      cerebral cortex. The genetic analyses of major neonatal epilepsies showed no 
      mutation. The neuropathology revealed atrophy and severe edema of the cerebral 
      cortex and white matter. GAD-immunohistochemistry exhibited imbalanced distribution 
      of GABAergic interneurons between the striatum and cerebral cortex. The results were 
      similar to those of focal cortical dysplasia with transmantle sign and X-linked 
      lissencephaly with ARX mutation. We performed various metabolic examinations, 
      detailed pathological investigations and genetic analyses, but could not identify 
      the cause. To our knowledge, her clinical and pathological courses have never been 
      described in the literature.

AB  - To assess the relationships between sleepiness and the incidence of adverse driving 
      events in nurses commuting to and from night and rotating shifts, 27 rotating and 
      permanent night shift-working nurses were asked to complete daily sleep and duty 
      logs, and wear wrist-activity monitors for 2 weeks (369 driving sessions). During 
      all commutes, ocular measures of drowsiness, including the Johns Drowsiness Scale 
      score, were assessed using the Optalert™ system. Participants self-reported their 
      subjective sleepiness at the beginning and end of each drive, and any events that 
      occurred during the drive. Rotating shift nurses reported higher levels of 
      sleepiness compared with permanent night shift nurses. In both shift-working groups, 
      self-reported sleepiness, drowsiness and drive events were significantly higher 
      during commutes following night shifts compared with commutes before night shifts. 
      Strong associations were found between objective drowsiness and increased odds of 
      driving events during commutes following night shifts. Maximum total blink duration 
      (mean = 7.96 s) during the drive and pre-drive Karolinska Sleepiness Scale 
      (mean = 5.0) were associated with greater incidence of sleep-related events [OR, 
      5.35 (95% CI, 1.32, 21.60), OR, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.04, 2.73), respectively]. 
      Inattention was strongly associated with a Johns Drowsiness Scale score equal to or 
      above 4.5 [OR, 4.58 (95% CI, 1.26-16.69)]. Hazardous driving events were more likely 
      to occur when drivers had been awake for 16 h or more [OR, 4.50 (95% CI, 1.81, 
      11.16)]. Under real-world driving conditions, shift-working nurses experience high

TI  - Effects of the fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor URB597 on coping behavior under 
      challenging conditions in mice.
PG  - 593-601

AB  - RATIONALE: Recent evidence suggests that in addition to controlling emotional 
      behavior in general, endocannabinoid signaling is engaged in shaping behavioral 
      responses to challenges. This important function of endocannabinoids is still poorly 
      understood. OBJECTIVES: Here we investigated the impact of blockade of fatty acid 
      amide hydrolase (FAAH), the degrading enzyme of anandamide on behavioral responses 
      induced by challenges of different intensity. METHODS: Mice treated with FAAH 
      inhibitor URB597 were either manually restrained on their backs (back test) or 
      received foot-shocks. RESULTS: The behavior of mice showed bimodal distribution in 
      the back test: they either predominantly showed escape attempts or equally 
      distributed time between passivity and escape. URB597 increased escapes in animals 
      with low escape scores. No effects were noticed in mice showing high escape scores, 
      which is likely due to a ceiling effect. We hypothesized that stronger stressors 
      would wash out individual differences in coping; therefore, we exposed mice to 
      foot-shocks that decreased locomotion and increased freezing in all mice. URB597 
      ameliorated both responses. The re-exposure of mice to the shock cage 14 days later 
      without delivering shocks or treatment was followed by reduced and fragmented sleep 
      as shown by electrophysiological recordings. Surprisingly, sleep was more disturbed 
      after the reminder than after shocks in rats receiving vehicle before foot-shocks. 
      These reminder-induced disturbances were abolished by URB597 administered before 
      shocks. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that FAAH blockade has an important role 
      in the selection of behavioral responses under challenging conditions and-judging 
      from its long-term effects-that it influences the cognitive appraisal of the 
      challenge.

TI  - The inhibition of neurons in the central nervous pathways for thermoregulatory cold 
      defense induces a suspended animation state in the rat.
PG  - 2984-93
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3596-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - The possibility of inducing a suspended animation state similar to natural torpor 
      would be greatly beneficial in medical science, since it would avoid the adverse 
      consequence of the powerful autonomic activation evoked by external cooling. 
      Previous attempts to systemically inhibit metabolism were successful in mice, but 
      practically ineffective in nonhibernators. Here we show that the selective 
      pharmacological inhibition of key neurons in the central pathways for 
      thermoregulatory cold defense is sufficient to induce a suspended animation state, 
      resembling natural torpor, in a nonhibernator. In rats kept at an ambient 
      temperature of 15°C and under continuous darkness, the prolonged inhibition (6 h) of 
      the rostral ventromedial medulla, a key area of the central nervous pathways for 
      thermoregulatory cold defense, by means of repeated microinjections (100 nl) of the 
      GABA(A) agonist muscimol (1 mm), induced the following: (1) a massive cutaneous 
      vasodilation; (2) drastic drops in deep brain temperature (reaching a nadir of 22.44 
      ± 0.74°C), heart rate (from 440 ± 13 to 207 ± 12 bpm), and electroencephalography 
      (EEG) power; (3) a modest decrease in mean arterial pressure; and (4) a progressive 
      shift of the EEG power spectrum toward slow frequencies. After the hypothermic bout, 
      all animals showed a massive increase in NREM sleep Delta power, similarly to that 
      occurring in natural torpor. No behavioral abnormalities were observed in the days 
      following the treatment. Our results strengthen the potential role of the CNS in the 
      induction of hibernation/torpor, since CNS-driven changes in organ physiology have 
      been shown to be sufficient to induce and maintain a suspended animation state.

TI  - Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography in male newborns <30 weeks' of gestation 
      and unfavourable neurodevelopmental outcome at three years is less mature when 
      compared to females.
PG  - e443-8
LID - 10.1111/apa.12334 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate gender-related differences in amplitude-integrated 
      electroencephalography (aEEG) associated with neurodevelopmental outcome at 3 years. 
      METHODS: Preterms born <30 weeks' gestational age between 2000 and 2002 were 
      prospectively included. aEEGs obtained within the first 2 weeks of life were 
      classified according to aEEG composite scores - including background pattern, 
      sleep-wake cycling (SWC) and seizure activity. Neurodevelopmental outcome was 
      assessed at 3 years of age. RESULTS: Neurodevelopmental outcome data was available 
      for 148 of 264 eligible infants - 64 showed a normal outcome and 84 an impaired 
      outcome. A logistic regression model revealed a significant independent influence of 
      IVH, analgetic/sedative/anticonvulsant medication, gestational age and gender on 
      aEEG composite scores. Odds ratios for having an abnormal aEEG composite score 
      within the first 2 weeks of life for 'female sex', 'no IVH', 'no medication' and 
      'gestational age' were calculated. aEEG did not differ between males and females 
      with normal outcomes. In patients with abnormal outcome, however, male preterms 
      showed more burst-suppression patterns and less SWC when compared with female 
      preterms. CONCLUSION: Being male with an abnormal outcome at 3 years of age is 
      reflected by a less mature early aEEG when compared with the one of females. This 
      association is independent of IVH and medication and was less evident with 
      increasing gestational age.

AB  - Many professions place significant mental and/or physical strain on their workers. 
      Some professionals (such as firefighters, soldiers, and pilots) have an inherent 
      responsibility for the safety of others. Making sure that workers in these remain 
      fit for duty is an important health/safety concern for the workers and those they 
      serve. This paper explores the viability of using EEG as a non-invasive, cost 
      efficient method for assessing fatigue, sleep deprivation, physical exertion and 
      stress. Specifically, P300 evoked potentials are generated in response to certain 
      stimuli. Variations in the response characteristics (magnitude, shape, and peak 
      shift) are explored in relation to sleep deprivation, caffeine usage, and physical 
      exertion. Preliminary data suggests that there are quantifiable changes to the P300 
      response that may be attributed to fatigue.

TI  - ERP evidence suggests executive dysfunction in ecstasy polydrug users.
PG  - 375-88
LID - 10.1007/s00213-013-3044-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficits in executive functions such as access to semantic/long-term 
      memory have been shown in ecstasy users in previous research. Equally, there have 
      been many reports of equivocal findings in this area. The current study sought to 
      further investigate behavioural and electro-physiological measures of this executive 
      function in ecstasy users. METHOD: Twenty ecstasy-polydrug users, 20 
      non-ecstasy-polydrug users and 20 drug-naïve controls were recruited. Participants 
      completed background questionnaires about their drug use, sleep quality, fluid 
      intelligence and mood state. Each individual also completed a semantic retrieval 
      task whilst 64 channel Electroencephalography (EEG) measures were recorded. RESULTS: 
      Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed no between-group differences in behavioural 
      performance on the task. Mixed ANOVA on event-related potential (ERP) components P2, 
      N2 and P3 revealed significant between-group differences in the N2 component. 
      Subsequent exploratory univariate ANOVAs on the N2 component revealed marginally 
      significant between-group differences, generally showing greater negativity at 
      occipito-parietal electrodes in ecstasy users compared to drug-naïve controls. 
      Despite absence of behavioural differences, differences in N2 magnitude are evidence 
      of abnormal executive functioning in ecstasy-polydrug users.

TI  - Drowsiness detection during different times of day using multiple features.
PG  - 243-50

AB  - Driver drowsiness has been one of the major causes of road accidents that lead to 
      severe trauma, such as physical injury, death, and economic loss, which highlights 
      the need to develop a system that can alert drivers of their drowsy state prior to 
      accidents. Researchers have therefore attempted to develop systems that can 
      determine driver drowsiness using the following four measures: (1) subjective 
      ratings from drivers, (2) vehicle-based measures, (3) behavioral measures and (4) 
      physiological measures. In this study, we analyzed the various factors that 
      contribute towards drowsiness. A total of 15 male subjects were asked to drive for 2 
      h at three different times of the day (00:00-02:00, 03:00-05:00 and 15:00-17:00 h) 
      when the circadian rhythm is low. The less intrusive physiological signal 
      measurements, ECG and EMG, are analyzed during this driving task. Statistically 
      significant differences in the features of ECG and sEMG signals were observed 
      between the alert and drowsy states of the drivers during different times of day. In 
      the future, these physiological measures can be fused with vision-based measures for 
      the development of an efficient drowsiness detection system.

TI  - Hippocampal theta rhythm induced by rostral pontine nucleus stimulation in the 
      conditions of pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus inactivation.

AB  - Theta rhythm in rat hippocampus occurs during cortical activation in different forms 
      of waking as well as during paradoxical phase of sleep. The multi-level regulatory 
      system of theta, based mainly on cholinergic transmission, includes structures from 
      the forebrain to the medulla. Among them the most important are two reticular 
      nuclei: the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) and rostral pontine tegmental 
      nucleus (RPO). Functional relations between these two nuclei are still unidentified. 
      It is known that cholinergic stimulation of these nuclei with carbachol leads to 
      induction of theta in the hippocampus. Electrical stimulation has the same effect 
      but only when applied to the RPO. In our experiments, performed on urethanized rats, 
      each of these two methods was applied to the RPO with the PPN being inactivated in 
      the contralateral hemisphere. We found that inactivation of the PPN does not 
      suppress theta induced with carbachol microinjection into the RPO, but completely 
      blocks theta induction with electrical stimulation of the RPO. The results suggest 
      the important role of the PPN in theta rhythm generation from brainstem level, 
      depending on the method of theta rhythm induction, i.e. cholinergic or electric 
      stimulation of the RPO.

TI  - A noradrenergic mechanism functions to couple motor behavior with arousal state.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate levels of skeletal muscle tone are needed to support routine 
      motor behaviors. But, the brain mechanisms that function to couple muscle tone with 
      waking behaviors are unknown. We addressed this question by studying mice with 
      cataplexy--a condition caused by a decoupling of motor and arousal behaviors. 
      Cataplexy is characterized by involuntary loss of muscle tone during wakefulness, 
      which results in postural collapse during otherwise normal consciousness. Cataplexy 
      is caused by loss of hypocretin (orexin) cells, but it is unknown how this loss 
      triggers motor inactivity during cataplexy. Here, we used hypocretin knockout mice 
      to identify the neurochemical cause of cataplexy and to determine the biochemical 
      mechanisms that normally function to couple arousal and motor systems. RESULTS: 
      Using genetic, behavioral, electrophysiological, and pharmacological approaches, we 
      show that the noradrenergic system acts to synchronize motor and arousal systems. 
      Specifically, we show that an excitatory noradrenergic drive maintains postural 
      muscle tone during wakefulness by activating α1 receptors on skeletal motoneurons. 
      Loss of this normal excitatory drive triggers motor inactivity during cataplexy by 
      reducing motoneuron excitation. However, loss of this drive does not affect arousal 
      since mice remain awake during cataplexy, suggesting the noradrenergic system is not 
      required for maintaining wakefulness. Artificial restoration of noradrenergic drive 
      to motoneurons prevents motor inactivity and rescues cataplexy. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      conclude that hypocretin deficiency causes cataplexy by short-circuiting the 
      noradrenergic drive to skeletal motoneurons. We suggest that the noradrenergic 
      system functions to couple the brain systems that control postural muscle tone and 
      behavioral arousal state.

TI  - Cross-frequency coupling during isoflurane anaesthesia as revealed by 
      electroencephalographic harmonic wavelet bicoherence.
PG  - 409-19
LID - 10.1093/bja/aes397 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fourier bicoherence has previously been applied to investigate phase 
      coupling in the EEG in anaesthesia. However, there are significant theoretical 
      limitations regarding its sensitivity in detecting transient episodes of 
      inter-frequency coupling. Therefore, we used a recently developed wavelet 
      bicoherence method to investigate the cross-frequency coupling in the EEG of 
      patients under isoflurane anaesthesia; examining the relationship between the 
      patterns of wavelet bicoherence and the isoflurane concentrations. METHODS: We 
      analysed a set of previously published EEG data, obtained from 29 patients who 
      underwent elective abdominal surgery under isoflurane anaesthesia. Artifact-free, 1 
      min EEG segments at different isoflurane concentrations were extracted from each 
      subject and the wavelet bicoherence calculated for all pairs of frequencies from 0.5 
      to 20 Hz. RESULTS: Isoflurane caused two peaks in the α (6-13 Hz) and slow δ (<1 Hz) 
      regions of the bicoherence matrix diagonal. Higher concentrations of isoflurane 
      shifted the α peak to lower frequencies [11.3 (0.9) Hz at 0.3% to 7.1 (1.2) Hz at 
      1.5%], as has been previously observed in the power spectra. Outside the diagonal, 
      we also found a significant α peak that was phase-coupled to the slow δ waves; 
      higher concentrations of isoflurane shifted this peak to lower frequencies [10.8 
      (1.2) to 7.7 (0.7) Hz]. CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane caused cross-frequency coupling 
      between α and slow δ waves. Increasing isoflurane concentration slowed the α 
      frequencies where the coupling had occurred. This phenomenon of α-δ coupling 
      suggests that slow cortical oscillations organize the higher α band activity, which 
      is consistent with other studies in natural sleep.

AB  - This article describes the two-process model of sleep regulation. The 24-hour 
      sleep-wake cycle is regulated by a homeostatic process and an endogenous, 2 
      oscillators, circadian process, under the influence of external synchronisers. These 
      two processes are partially independent but influence each other, as shown in the 
      two-sleep-process auto-regulation model. A reciprocal inhibition model of two 
      interconnected neuronal groups, "SP on" and "SP off", explains the regular 
      recurrence of paradoxical sleep. Sleep studies have primarily depended on 
      observation of the subject and have determined the optimal conditions for sleep 
      (position, external conditions, sleep duration and need) and have studied the 
      consequences of sleep deprivation or modifications of sleep schedules. Then, 
      electrophysiological recordings permitted the classification of sleep stages 
      according to the observed EEG patterns. The course of a night's sleep is reported on 
      a "hypnogram". The adult subject falls asleep in non-REM sleep (N1), then sleep 
      deepens progressively to stages N2 and N3 with the appearance of spindles and slow 
      waves (N2). Slow waves become more numerous in stage N3. Every 90minutes REM sleep 
      recurs, with muscle atonia and rapid eye movements. These adult sleep patterns 
      develop progressively during the 2 first years of life as total sleep duration 
      decreases, with the reduction of diurnal sleep and of REM sleep. Around 2 to 4 
      months, spindles and K complexes appear on the EEG, with the differentiation of 
      light and deep sleep with, however, a predominance of slow wave sleep.

AB  - We investigated whether the perifornical-lateral hypothalamic area (PF-LHA), where 
      the orexin neurons reside, is a central chemoreceptor site by microdialysis of 
      artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) equilibrated with 25% CO(2) into PF-LHA in 
      conscious rats. This treatment is known to produce a focal tissue acidification like 
      that associated with a 6-7 mm Hg increase in arterial [Formula: see text] . Such 
      focal acidification in the PF-LHA significantly increased ventilation up to 15% 
      compared with microdialysis of normal aCSF equilibrated with 5% CO(2) only in 
      wakefulness but not in sleep in both the dark (P=0.004) and light (P<0.001) phases 
      of the diurnal cycle. This response was predominantly due to a significant increase 
      in respiratory frequency (11%, P<0.001). There were no significant effects on 
      ventilation in the group with probes misplaced outside the PF-LHA. These results 
      suggest that PF-LHA functions as a central chemoreceptor site in the central nervous 
      system in a vigilant state dependent manner with predominant effects in wakefulness.

TI  - Sleep disturbances as the hallmark of PTSD: where are we now?
PG  - 372-82
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12040432 [doi]
AB  - The hypothesis that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disturbances are the hallmark of 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), proposed by Ross and colleagues in 1989, has 
      stimulated a wealth of clinical, preclinical, and animal studies on the role of 
      sleep in the pathophysiology of PTSD. The present review revisits this influential 
      hypothesis in light of clinical and experimental findings that have since 
      accumulated. Polysomnographic studies conducted in adults with PTSD have yielded 
      mixed findings regarding REM sleep disturbances, and they generally suggest modest 
      and nonspecific sleep disruptions. Prospective and treatment studies have provided 
      more robust evidence for the relationship between sleep disturbances and psychiatric 
      outcomes and symptoms. Experimental animal and human studies that have probed the 
      relationship between REM sleep and fear responses, as well as studies focused more 
      broadly on sleep-dependent affective and memory processes, also provide strong 
      support for the hypothesis that sleep plays an important role in PTSD-relevant 
      processes. Overall, the literature suggests that disturbed REM or non-REM sleep can 
      contribute to maladaptive stress and trauma responses and may constitute a 
      modifiable risk factor for poor psychiatric outcomes. Clinicians need to consider 
      that the chronic sleep disruption associated with nightmares may affect the efficacy 
      of first-line PTSD treatments, but targeted sleep treatments may accelerate recovery 
      from PTSD. The field is ripe for prospective and longitudinal studies in high-risk 
      groups to clarify how changes in sleep physiology and neurobiology contribute to 
      increased risk of poor psychiatric outcomes.

TI  - Enhanced histaminergic neurotransmission and sleep-wake alterations, a study in 
      histamine H3-receptor knock-out mice.
PG  - 1015-31
LID - 10.1038/npp.2012.266 [doi]
AB  - Long-term abolition of a brain arousal system impairs wakefulness (W), but little is 
      known about the consequences of long-term enhancement. The brain histaminergic 
      arousal system is under the negative control of H3-autoreceptors whose deletion 
      results in permanent enhancement of histamine (HA) turnover. In order to determine 
      the consequences of enhancement of the histaminergic system, we compared the 
      cortical EEG and sleep-wake states of H3-receptor knockout (H3R-/-) and wild-type 
      mouse littermates. We found that H3R-/-mice had rich phenotypes. On the one hand, 
      they showed clear signs of enhanced HA neurotransmission and vigilance, i.e., a 
      higher EEG θ power during spontaneous W and a greater extent of W or sleep 
      restriction during behavioral tasks, including environmental change, locomotion, and 
      motivation tests. On the other hand, during the baseline dark period, they displayed 
      deficient W and signs of sleep deterioration, such as pronounced sleep fragmentation 
      and reduced cortical slow activity during slow wave sleep (SWS), most likely due to 
      a desensitization of postsynaptic histaminergic receptors as a result of constant HA 
      release. Ciproxifan (H3-receptor inverse agonist) enhanced W in wild-type mice, but 
      not in H3R-/-mice, indicating a functional deletion of H3-receptors, whereas 
      triprolidine (postsynaptic H1-receptor antagonist) or α-fluoromethylhistidine 
      (HA-synthesis inhibitor) caused a greater SWS increase in H3R-/- than in wild-type 
      mice, consistent with enhanced HA neurotransmission. These sleep-wake 
      characteristics and the obesity phenotypes previously reported in this animal model 
      suggest that chronic enhancement of histaminergic neurotransmission eventually 
      compromises the arousal system, leading to sleep-wake, behavioral, and metabolic 
      disorders similar to those caused by voluntary sleep restriction in humans.

      disease mutation.
PG  - 2147-58
LID - 10.1093/brain/awt128 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disturbances in Huntington's disease may be deleterious to the cognitive 
      performance, affective behaviour, and general well-being of patients, but a 
      comprehensive description of the progression of changes in sleep and 
      electroencephalogram in Huntington's disease has never been conducted. Here we 
      studied sleep and electroencephalogram disturbances in a transgenic mouse model of 
      Huntington's disease (R6/2 mice). We implanted 10 R6/2 mice and five wild-type 
      littermates with electromyography electrodes, frontofrontal and frontoparietal 
      electroencephalogram electrodes and then recorded sleep/wake behaviour at 
      presymptomatic, symptomatic and late stages of the disease. In addition to 
      sleep-wake scoring, we performed a spectral analysis of the sleep 
      electroencephalogram. We found that sleep and electroencephalogram were already 
      significantly disrupted in R6/2 mice at 9 weeks of age (presymptomatic stage). By 
      the time they were symptomatic, R6/2 mice were unable to maintain long periods of 
      wakefulness and had an increased propensity for rapid eye movement sleep. In 
      addition, the peak frequency of theta rhythm was shifted progressively from 7 Hz to 
      6 Hz during rapid eye movement sleep, whereas slow wave activity decreased gradually 
      during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Finally, as the disease progressed, an abnormal 
      electroencephalogram gamma activity (30-40 Hz) emerged in R6/2 mice irrespective of 
      sleep states. This is reminiscent of the increased gamma power described in 
      schizophrenic patients during sleep and events of psychosis. Gaining a better 
      understanding of sleep and electroencephalogram changes in patients with 
      Huntington's disease should be a priority, since it will enable clinicians to 
      initiate appropriate investigations and to instigate treatments that could 
      dramatically improve patients' quality of life.

AB  - We hypothesized that administration of clonidine would decrease the hypocapnic 
      apnoeic threshold (HAT) and widen the CO(2) reserve during non-REM sleep. METHODS: 
      Ten healthy subjects (4 females) (age 22.3 ± 3.0 years; BMI 25.5 ± 3.4 kg/m(2)) were 
      randomized to receive placebo or 0.1 mg/45 kg of clonidine on 2 separate nights. 
      Ventilation and upper airway resistance were monitored during wakefulness and sleep. 
      Two separate experiments were performed: Protocol 1 (n=8), CO(2) reserve, HAT and 
      HcVR were determined using non-invasive hyperventilation (NIV) to induce hypocapnia 
      for at least 3 min; Protocol 2 (n=6), peripheral hypocapnic ventilatory response 
      (HcVR) was determined by NIV using short (3 breaths) hyperventilation. RESULTS: 
      Clonidine decreased the systolic blood pressure by 12 ± 10 mmHg but did not affect 
      baseline ventilation or upper airway resistance during wakefulness or sleep. 
      Protocol (1), clonidine was associated with decreased HAT relative to placebo (37.3 
      ± 3.3 mmHg vs. 39.7 ± 3.4 mmHg, P<0.05), increased CO(2) reserve (-3.8 ± 1.3 mmHg 
      vs. -2.8 ± 1.2 mmHg, P<0.05), and decreased HcVR (1.6 ± 0.6 L/min/mmHg vs. 2.5 ± 1.3 
      L/min/mmHg, P<0.05). Protocol (2), administration of clonidine did not decrease 
      peripheral HcVR compared to placebo (0.5 ± 0.3 L/min/mmHg vs. 0.7 ± 0.3 L/min/mmHg, 
      P=NS). CONCLUSION: Clonidine is associated with diminished susceptibility to 
      hypocapnic central apnoea without significant effect on ventilation or upper airway 
      mechanics. Reduced susceptibility to hypocapnic central apnoea is not explained by 
      the peripheral chemoreceptor pathway. This suggests a central rather than a 
      peripheral effect of clonidine on the susceptibility to hypocapnic central apnoea.

TI  - Orbicularis oculi muscle activation during swallowing in humans.
PG  - 79-91
LID - 10.1007/s00221-012-3290-6 [doi]
AB  - Intraoral trigeminal afferents elicit EMG activity from the lower facial muscle, 
      orbicularis oris (OR) during swallowing. The upper facial muscles and especially 
      orbicularis oculi (OC) were not previously known to be associated with deglutitional 
      events. Nevertheless, given the large area of intraoral mucosa and teeth innervated 
      by the trigeminal nerve afferents, a connection between OC motoneurons and 
      deglutition may theoretically be expected, which we sought to evaluate in this 
      study. Healthy controls were investigated for the possible synchronization of 
      orbicularis OC and OR muscles during deglutition by the following methods: EMG 
      activities were recorded during voluntary dry, 3-, 10-, 20-ml discrete wet 
      swallowing, and sequential swallowing from a cup, concurrent with respiratory 
      recording. A polygraphic recording was obtained from these muscles to determine 
      whether they were synchronously activated during spontaneous swallowing. The 
      polygraphic recording during spontaneous swallowing demonstrated that the OC and OR 
      muscles were synchronously activated in all subjects. This synchronous activation 
      was less prominent in voluntary discrete swallowing. It is proposed that this might 
      be based on trigemino-solitarii-facial pathways with weaker connection to OC 
      muscles. The synchronization of OC muscle activity with deglutition may be an 
      evolutionary process that should be rudimentary in higher mammals including humans. 
      The swallowing-induced cranial muscle activities could potentially explain some 
      movement disorders, such as craniofacial dystonias.

TI  - Auditory evoked arousal responses of 3-month-old infants exposed to methamphetamine 
      in utero: a nap study.
PG  - 424-30
LID - 10.1111/apa.12136 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether or not infants exposed to methamphetamine prenatally 
      have impaired arousal responses from sleep. METHODS: The polygraphic nap studies 
      involved 42 infants aged 3 months exposed to methamphetamine in utero and a 
      comparison group of 57 infants. A proportion of mothers in both groups smoked 
      cigarettes and/or marijuana and drank alcohol during pregnancy. White noise from 50 
      to 100 decibels (dB) was administered at 10 dB intervals twice within non-rapid eye 
      movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep states and arousal thresholds 
      measured. RESULTS: Combining groups, 306 tests were completed (128 and 178 within 
      REM and NREM sleep, respectively) and infants were more likely to wake at lower 
      thresholds in REM than NREM sleep (hazard ratio 5.58; 95% CI, 3.78-8.23 p < 0.0001). 
      No significant differences in arousal threshold were found between methamphetamine 
      and comparison groups, before or after controlling for other substance use (NREM 
      sleep; 0.98, 95% CI, 0.60-1.59 and REM sleep; 1.03, 95% CI, 0.56-1.89). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that arousal responses of methamphetamine-exposed infants 
      remain intact, providing no support for the hypothesis that prenatal exposure could 
      increase their vulnerability to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) through arousal 
      deficits.

TI  - Gamma band activity in the RAS-intracellular mechanisms.
PG  - 1509-22
LID - 10.1007/s00221-013-3794-8 [doi]
AB  - Gamma band activity participates in sensory perception, problem solving, and memory. 
      This review considers recent evidence showing that cells in the reticular activating 
      system (RAS) exhibit gamma band activity, and describes the intrinsic membrane 
      properties behind such manifestation. Specifically, we discuss how cells in the 
      mesopontine pedunculopontine nucleus, intralaminar parafascicular nucleus, and 
      pontine SubCoeruleus nucleus dorsalis all fire in the gamma band range when 
      maximally activated, but no higher. The mechanisms involve high-threshold, 
      voltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channels, or sodium-dependent subthreshold 
      oscillations. Rather than participating in the temporal binding of sensory events as 
      in the cortex, gamma band activity in the RAS may participate in the processes of 
      preconscious awareness and provide the essential stream of information for the 
      formulation of many of our actions. We address three necessary next steps resulting 
      from these discoveries: an intracellular mechanism responsible for maintaining gamma 
      band activity based on persistent G-protein activation, separate intracellular 
      pathways that differentiate between gamma band activity during waking versus during 
      REM sleep, and an intracellular mechanism responsible for the dysregulation in gamma 
      band activity in schizophrenia. These findings open several promising research 
      avenues that have not been thoroughly explored. What are the effects of sleep or REM 
      sleep deprivation on these RAS mechanisms? Are these mechanisms involved in memory 
      processing during waking and/or during REM sleep? Does gamma band processing differ 
      during waking versus REM sleep after sleep or REM sleep deprivation?

AB  - Sleep and the functional connectome are research areas with considerable overlap. 
      Neuroimaging studies of sleep based on EEG-PET and EEG-fMRI are revealing the brain 
      networks that support sleep, as well as networks that may support the roles and 
      processes attributed to sleep. For example, phenomena such as arousal and 
      consciousness are substantially modulated during sleep, and one would expect this 
      modulation to be reflected in altered network activity. In addition, recent work 
      suggests that sleep also has a number of adaptive functions that support waking 
      activity. Thus the study of sleep may elucidate the circuits and processes that 
      support waking function and complement information obtained from fMRI during waking 
      conditions. In this review, we will discuss examples of this for memory, arousal, 
      and consciousness after providing a brief background on sleep and on studying it 
      with fMRI.

AB  - Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone produced mainly by the gastrointestinal system and 
      the brain. Much evidence also indicates a role for ghrelin in sleep and 
      thermoregulation. Further, ghrelin was recently implicated in immune system 
      modulation. Administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces fever, 
      anorexia, and increased non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) and these actions are 
      mediated primarily by proinflammatory cytokines. Ghrelin reduces LPS-induced fever, 
      suppresses circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines and reduces the severity 
      and mortality of various models of experimental endotoxemia. In the present study, 
      we determined the role of intact ghrelin signaling in LPS-induced sleep, feeding, 
      and thermoregulatory responses in mice. Sleep-wake activity was determined after 
      intraperitoneal, dark onset administration of 0.4, 2 and 10 μg LPS in preproghrelin 
      knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, body temperature, motor activity 
      and changes in 24-h food intake and body weight were measured. LPS induced 
      dose-dependent increases in NREMS, and suppressed rapid-eye movement sleep, 
      electroencephalographic slow-wave activity, motor activity, food intake and body 
      weight in both Ppg KO and WT mice. Body temperature changes showed a biphasic 
      pattern with a decrease during the dark period followed by an increase in the light 
      phase. The effects of the low and middle doses of LPS were indistinguishable between 
      the two genotypes. Administration of 10 μg LPS, however, induced significantly 
      larger changes in NREMS and wakefulness amounts, body temperature, food intake and 
      body weight in the Ppg KO mice. These findings support a role for ghrelin as an 
      endogenous modulator of inflammatory responses and a central component of arousal 
      and feeding circuits.

TI  - Is sleep essential for neural plasticity in humans, and how does it affect motor and

AB  - There is a general consensus that sleep is strictly linked to memory, learning, and, 
      in general, to the mechanisms of neural plasticity, and that this link may directly 
      affect recovery processes. In fact, a coherent pattern of empirical findings points 
      to beneficial effect of sleep on learning and plastic processes, and changes in 
      synaptic plasticity during wakefulness induce coherent modifications in EEG slow 
      wave cortical topography during subsequent sleep. However, the specific nature of 
      the relation between sleep and synaptic plasticity is not clear yet. We reported 
      findings in line with two models conflicting with respect to the underlying 
      mechanisms, that is, the "synaptic homeostasis hypothesis" and the "consolidation" 
      hypothesis, and some recent results that may reconcile them. Independently from the 
      specific mechanisms involved, sleep loss is associated with detrimental effects on 
      plastic processes at a molecular and electrophysiological level. Finally, we 
      reviewed growing evidence supporting the notion that plasticity-dependent recovery 
      could be improved managing sleep quality, while monitoring EEG during sleep may help 
      to explain how specific rehabilitative paradigms work. We conclude that a better 
      understanding of the sleep-plasticity link could be crucial from a rehabilitative 
      point of view.

      examined the associations among interpersonal distress, objective and subjective 
      sleep in people with and without insomnia. METHODS: Participants in this 
      cross-sectional observational study included men and women with insomnia (n = 28) 
      and good sleeper controls (n = 38). Interpersonal distress was measured with the 
      Inventory of Interpersonal Problems. Sleep parameters included insomnia severity, 
      self-reported presleep arousal, and sleep quality; and polysomnographically-assessed 
      sleep latency (SL), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), percent 
      delta (stage 3 + 4 NREM), percent REM, and EEG beta power. Hierarchical linear 
      regression was used to assess the relationship between distress from interpersonal 
      problems and sleep and the extent to which relationships differed among insomnia 
      patients and controls. RESULTS: More interpersonal distress was associated with more 
      self-reported arousal and higher percentage of REM. More interpersonal distress was 
      associated with greater insomnia severity and more cognitive presleep arousal for 
      individuals with insomnia, but not for controls. Contrary to expectations, 
      interpersonal distress was associated with shorter sleep latency in the insomnia 
      group. Results were attenuated, but still significant, after adjusting for 
      depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: Distress from interpersonal problems is associated 
      with greater self-reported arousal and higher percent REM. Individuals with insomnia 
      who report more distress from interpersonal problems have greater insomnia severity 
      and cognitive presleep arousal, perhaps due to rumination. These findings extend our 
      knowledge of the association between interpersonal stressors and sleep. Assessment 
      and consideration of interpersonal distress could provide a novel target for 
      insomnia treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to retrospectively analyze the electroclinical 
      features, etiology, treatment, and prognosis of 29 patients with Landau-Kleffner 
      syndrome (LKS) with a long-term follow-up. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were a 
      diagnosis of LKS with: (1) acquired aphasia or verbal auditory aphasia; (2) with or 
      without focal seizures, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absences, or 
      atonic seizures. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 12 years. All cases except six had 
      seizures. Before the onset of aphasia, developmental language and behavioral 
      disturbances were present in 19 and 14 patients, respectively. All patients had 
      verbal auditory agnosia. Aphasia was severe in 24 patients and moderate in five. 
      Nonlinguistic cognitive dysfunctions were moderate in 14 patients. Behavioral 
      disturbances were found in 16 patients. During the continuous spike-and-wave 
      discharges during slow sleep phase, the spike-wave index was >85% in 15, 50-85% in 
      eight, and 30-50% in four. In two patients, the EEG recording showed occasional 
      bilateral spikes, without continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep. In 
      this phase, the awake EEG recording showed more frequent interictal abnormalities, 
      predominantly in the temporal regions. Eight patients recovered language completely, 
      but the remaining patients continue to have language deficits of different degrees. 
      CONCLUSION: Landau-Kleffner syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by 
      acquired verbal auditory aphasia and seizures in most of the patients associated 
      with continuous or almost continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow wave 
      sleep. The most commonly used treatments were clobazam, ethosuximide, sulthiame. 
      High-dose steroids were also administered. Adequate and early management may avoid 
      language and cognitive deterioration.

TI  - Sleep slow-wave activity regulates cerebral glycolytic metabolism.
PG  - 1978-87
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhs189 [doi]
AB  - Non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) onset is characterized by a reduction in 
      cerebral metabolism and an increase in slow waves, 1-4-Hz oscillations between 
      relatively depolarized and hyperpolarized states in the cerebral cortex. The 
      metabolic consequences of slow-wave activity (SWA) at the cellular level remain 
      uncertain. We sought to determine whether SWA modulates the rate of glycolysis 
      within the cerebral cortex. The real-time measurement of lactate concentration in 
      the mouse cerebral cortex demonstrates that it increases during enforced 
      wakefulness. In spontaneous sleep/wake cycles, lactate concentration builds during 
      wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep and declines during NREMS. The rate at 
      which lactate concentration declines during NREMS is proportional to the magnitude 
      of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at frequencies of <10 Hz. The induction of 
      1-Hz oscillations, but not 10-Hz oscillations, in the electroencephalogram by 
      optogenetic stimulation of cortical pyramidal cells during wakefulness triggers a 
      decline in lactate concentration. We conclude that cerebral SWA promotes a decline 
      in the rate of glycolysis in the cerebral cortex. These results demonstrate a 
      cellular energetic function for sleep SWA, which may contribute to its restorative 
      effects on brain function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is increasingly used in research with 
      premature infants; however, comprehensive interpretation is limited by the lack of 
      simple approaches for reliably quantifying and summarizing the data. AIM: Explore 
      operational measures for quantifying continuity and discontinuity, measured by aEEG 
      as components of infant brain function. STUDY DESIGN: An exploratory naturalistic 
      study of neonates while in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). One single 
      channel aEEG recording per infant was obtained without disruption of nursing care 
      practices. SUBJECTS: 24 infants with mean postmenstrual age (PMA) of 33.11 weeks (SD 
      3.49), average age of 2.62 weeks (SD 1.35) and mean birth weights of 1.39 kg (SD 
      0.73). OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantification of continuity and discontinuity included 
      bandwidth and lower border of aEEG, calculated proportion of time with signal 
      amplitude below 10 μV, and peak counts. Variance of bandwidth and lower border 
      denoted cycling. RESULTS: Group mean bandwidth was 52.98 μV (SD 27.62). Median peak 
      count in 60 second epochs averaged 3.63 (SD 1.74), while median proportion < 10 μV 
      was 22% (SD 0.20). The group mean of lower border within-subject aggregated medians 
      was 6.20 μV (SD 2.13). Group mean lower border standard deviation was 3.96 μV. 
      Proportion < 10 μV showed a strong negative correlation with the natural log of the 
      lower border median (r = -0.906, p < .0001) after controlling for PMA. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study introduces a novel quantification process by counting peaks and 
      proportion of time < 10 μV. Expanded definitions and analytic techniques will serve 
      to strengthen the application of existing scoring systems for use in naturalistic 
      research settings and clinical practice.

AB  - Patients suffering from the sleep disorder idiopathic rapid-eye-movement sleep 
      behavior disorder (iRBD) have been observed to be in high risk of developing 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). This makes it essential to analyze them in the search for 
      PD biomarkers. This study aims at classifying patients suffering from iRBD or PD 
      based on features reflecting eye movements (EMs) during sleep. A Latent Dirichlet 
      Allocation (LDA) topic model was developed based on features extracted from two 
      electrooculographic (EOG) signals measured as parts in full night polysomnographic 
      (PSG) recordings from ten control subjects. The trained model was tested on ten 
      other control subjects, ten iRBD patients and ten PD patients, obtaining a EM topic 
      mixture diagram for each subject in the test dataset. Three features were extracted 
      from the topic mixture diagrams, reflecting "certainty", "fragmentation" and 
      "stability" in the timely distribution of the EM topics. Using a Naive Bayes (NB) 
      classifier and the features "certainty" and "stability" yielded the best 
      classification result and the subjects were classified with a sensitivity of 95 %, a 
      specificity of 80% and an accuracy of 90 %. This study demonstrates in a data-driven 
      approach, that iRBD and PD patients may exhibit abnorm form and/or timely 
      distribution of EMs during sleep.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electroencephalography (EEG) is used for studying functional disorders 
      of the brain. We provide an overview of the areas where EEG is most strongly 
      indicated and the clinical benefit of the examination. METHOD: This article is based 
      on articles from personal literature archives and literature searches in PubMed, 
      textbook on methods in clinical neurophysiology, the work of one of the authors on a 
      new European standard for EEG and the authors' clinical experience. RESULTS: EEG is 
      primarily indicated for assessing suspected epileptic seizures and encephalopathies. 
      Standard EEG, sleep-deprived EEG and long-term EEG examinations are used in 
      diagnosing epilepsy. EEG will identify epileptiform activity in about 90% of 
      patients with epilepsy. Epileptiform EEG activity in these patients will provide 
      support for the diagnosis of epilepsy, while the absence of such activity will not 
      exclude the diagnosis. EEG is also important for classifying the type of epileptic 
      syndrome. In cases of encephalopathy, pathology will take the form of an increase in 
      slow activity on the EEG and will support the diagnosis, but as a rule the EEG 
      finding is non-specific. Findings in some cases may point to the underlying 
      aetiology. INTERPRETATION: Electroencephalograms must be interpreted by an 
      experienced clinical neurophysiologist or neurologist with specialist expertise in 
      EEG interpretation, and must always be evaluated in the light of the clinical 
      picture.

AB  - By combining electroencephalography (EEG) with functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) it is possible to describe blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal 
      changes related to EEG patterns. This way, EEG-pattern-associated networks of 
      hemodynamic changes can be detected anywhere in the brain with good spatial 
      resolution. This review summarizes EEG-fMRI studies that have been performed in 
      children with epilepsy. EEG-fMRI studies in focal epilepsy (structural and 
      nonlesional cases, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes), generalized epilepsy 
      (especially absence epilepsy), and epileptic encephalopathies (West syndrome, 
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, continuous spike and waves during slow sleep, and Dravet 
      syndrome) are presented. Although EEG-fMRI was applied mainly to localize the region 
      presumably generating focal interictal discharges in focal epilepsies, EEG-fMRI 
      identified underlying networks in patients with generalized epilepsies and thereby 
      contributed to a better understanding of these epilepsies. In epileptic 
      encephalopathies a specific fingerprint of hemodynamic changes associated with the 
      particular syndrome was detected. The value of the EEG-fMRI technique for diagnosis 
      and investigation of pathogenetic mechanisms of different forms of epilepsy is 
      discussed.

AB  - Sleep and wake are actively promoted states of consciousness that are dependent on a 
      network of state-modulating neurons arising from both the brain stem and 
      hypothalamus. This network helps to coordinate the occurrence of a sleep state in 
      billions of cortical neurons. In many neurological diseases, there is a specific 
      disruption to one of the components of this network. Under conditions of such 
      disruptions, we often gain an improved understanding of the underlying function of 
      the specific component under nonpathological conditions. The loss or dysfunction of 
      one of the hypothalamic or brain stem regions that are responsible for promotion of 
      sleep or wake can lead to disruptions in sleep and wake states that are often 
      subtle, but sometime quite pronounced and of significant medical importance. By 
      understanding the neural substrate and its pathophysiology, one can more 
      appropriately target therapies that might help the specific sleep disruption. This 
      chapter reviews what is currently understood about the neurobiological underpinnings 
      of sleep and wake regulation and how various pathologies evoke changes in these 
      regulatory mechanisms.

AB  - Data on the sleep disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease are given. The 
      basic point focuses on analysis of paradoxical sleep without muscle atonia. The 
      author reports developed models of preclinical and clinical stages of Parkinson's 
      disease in Wistar rats on the basis ofa moderate and deep attenuation in activity of 
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, a key mechanism of aging and development of 
      conformation disease. The hypothesis about changes in the characteristics of 
      paradoxical sleep as a marker of parkinsonism stages is validated. It reflects the 
      state of compensator and neuroprotective reserves of nigrostriatal dophaminergic 
      system.

AB  - Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) delta power 
      (~0.5-4 Hz), also known as slow wave activity (SWA), is typically enhanced after 
      acute sleep deprivation (SD) but not after chronic sleep restriction (CSR). 
      Recently, sleep-active cortical neurons expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase 
      (nNOS) were identified and associated with enhanced SWA after short acute bouts of 
      SD (i.e., 6h). However, the relationship between cortical nNOS neuronal activity and 
      SWA during CSR is unknown. We compared the activity of cortical neurons expressing 
      nNOS (via c-Fos and nNOS immuno-reactivity, respectively) and sleep in rats in three 
      conditions: (1) after 18-h of acute SD; (2) after five consecutive days of sleep 
      restriction (SR) (18-h SD per day with 6h ad libitum sleep opportunity per day); (3) 
      and time-of-day matched ad libitum sleep controls. Cortical nNOS neuronal activity 
      was enhanced during sleep after both 18-h SD and 5 days of SR treatments compared to 
      control treatments. SWA and NREM sleep delta energy (the product of NREM sleep 
      duration and SWA) were positively correlated with enhanced cortical nNOS neuronal 
      activity after 18-h SD but not 5days of SR. That neurons expressing nNOS were active 
      after longer amounts of acute SD (18h vs. 6h reported in the literature) and were 
      correlated with SWA further suggest that these cells might regulate SWA. However, 
      since these neurons were active after CSR when SWA was not enhanced, these findings 
      suggest that mechanisms downstream of their activation are altered during CSR.

AB  - To listen to brain activity as a piece of music, we previously proposed scale-free 
      brainwave music (SFBM) technology, which translated the scalp electroencephalogram 
      (EEG) into musical notes according to the power law of both the EEG and music. In 
      this study, the methodology was further extended to ensemble music on two channels 
      from the two hemispheres. EEG data from two channels symmetrically located on the 
      left and right hemispheres were translated into MIDI sequences by SFBM, and the EEG 
      parameters modulated the pitch, duration and volume of each note. Then, the two 
      sequences were filtered into an ensemble with two voices: the pentatonic scale 
      (traditional Chinese music) or the heptatonic scale (standard Western music). We 
      demonstrated differences in harmony between the two scales generated at different 
      sleep stages, with the pentatonic scale being more harmonious. The harmony intervals 
      of this brain ensemble at various sleep stages followed the power law. Compared with 
      the heptatonic scale, it was easier to distinguish the different stages using the 
      pentatonic scale. These results suggested that the hemispheric ensemble can 
      represent brain activity by variations in pitch, tempo and harmony. The ensemble 
      with the pentatonic scale sounds more consonant, and partially reflects the 
      relations of the two hemispheres. This can be used to distinguish the different 
      states of brain activity and provide a new perspective on EEG analysis.

TI  - Respiration during sleep in children with therapy-resistant enuresis.
PG  - 300-4
LID - 10.1111/apa.12515 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Although there is a known association between enuresis and snoring or sleep 
      apnoeas, respiration during sleep has not been thoroughly studied in enuretic 
      children. This study was performed with the aim of filling this gap in our 
      knowledge. METHODS: Thirty-four children with therapy-resistant enuresis, but no 
      history of heavy snoring or sleep apnoeas, underwent sleep registrations, including 
      standard electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) as well as 
      registration of oxygen saturation, respiratory effort and nasal air flow. To assess 
      nasal airway patency, rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry were performed before 
      and after nasal decongestion. RESULTS: The children were found to have a higher than 
      expected apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI), due to a high frequency of hypopnoeas. They 
      were also noted to have a tendency for respiratory arousals. Standard 
      polysomnographic variables were normal. CONCLUSION: We provide baseline data of 
      nocturnal respiration in enuretic children. The children were found to have 
      subclinical signs of disordered respiration. This may be one of the explanations for 
      their high arousal thresholds.

AB  - RATIONALE: Atypical benign partial epilepsy (ABPE) is characterized by 
      centro-temporal electroencephalography (EEG) spikes, continuous spike and waves 
      during sleep (CSWS), and multiple seizure types including epileptic negative 
      myoclonus (ENM), but not tonic seizures. This study evaluated the localization of 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) spike sources (MEGSSs) to investigate the clinical 
      features and mechanism underlying ABPE. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed seizure 
      profiles, scalp video EEG (VEEG) and MEG in ABPE patients. RESULTS: Eighteen ABPE 
      patients were identified (nine girls and nine boys). Seizure onset ranged from 1.3 
      to 8.8years (median, 2.9years). Initial seizures consisted of focal motor seizures 
      (15 patients) and absences/atypical absences (3). Seventeen patients had multiple 
      seizure types including drop attacks (16), focal motor seizures (16), ENM (14), 
      absences/atypical absences (11) and focal myoclonic seizures (10). VEEG showed 
      centro-temporal spikes and CSWS in all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      was reported as normal in all patients. MEGSSs were localized over the following 
      regions: both Rolandic and sylvian (8), peri-sylvian (5), peri-Rolandic (4), 
      parieto-occipital (1), bilateral (10) and unilateral (8). All patients were on more 
      than two antiepileptic medications. ENM and absences/atypical absences were 
      controlled in 14 patients treated with adjunctive ethosuximide. CONCLUSION: MEG 
      localized the source of centro-temporal spikes and CSWS in the Rolandic-sylvian 
      regions. Centro-temporal spikes, Rolandic-sylvian spike sources and focal motor 
      seizures are evidence that ABPE presents with Rolandic-sylvian onset seizures. ABPE 
      is therefore a unique, age-related and localization-related epilepsy with a 
      Rolandic-sylvian epileptic focus plus possible thalamo-cortical epileptic networks 
      in the developing brain of children.

AB  - PURPOSE: The case report published in this issue by Wang et al. offers us an 
      opportunity to review previously published "ictal epileptic headache" cases and draw 
      attention to the criteria that have recently been published for this condition, 
      taking into consideration not only the clinical-EEG and physiopathogenetic 
      investigations required to diagnose this condition, but also the therapeutic aspects 
      of the issue. METHODS: To this aim we reviewed all well-documented cases that have 
      been reported in the literature. RESULTS: The relationship between headache and 
      seizures is somewhat complicated. Although the nature of this association is not yet 
      fully clear, several plausible explanations have been proposed. Further experimental 
      and clinical investigations are, however, warranted to gain a better understanding 
      of this relationship. Epilepsy and idiopathic headache/migraine share several 
      pathophysiological mechanisms; a better understanding of these mechanisms will allow 
      us to more accurately to assess the "real burden" and prevalence of the "ictal 
      epileptic headache" phenomenon and its therapeutic implications. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      development of animal models and molecular studies and, above all, multicenter 
      clinical studies conducted according to the proposed IEH criteria represent the 
      starting point for a definitive international consensus on this intriguing topic. In 
      addition, to improve the recognition of ictal epileptic headache, we should 
      encourage the use of EEG recording in the emergency setting.

TI  - Effects of suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist, on sleep parameters as 
      measured by polysomnography in healthy men.
PG  - 259-67
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2386 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Suvorexant (MK-4305) is an orexin receptor antagonist being 
      developed for the treatment of insomnia. This report describes the effects of 
      nighttime administration of suvorexant on polysomnography (PSG) sleep parameters in 
      healthy young men. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-period 
      crossover PSG study, followed by an additional 5(th) period to assess 
      pharmacokinetics. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy young men between 
      18 and 45 years of age (22 enrolled, 19 completed). INTERVENTIONS: Periods 1-4: 
      suvorexant (10 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg) or placebo 1 h before nighttime PSG recording. 
      Period 5: suvorexant 10 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In Periods 
      1-4, overnight sleep parameters were recorded by PSG and next-morning residual 
      effects were assessed by psychomotor performance tests and subjective assessments. 
      Statistically significant sleep-promoting effects were observed with all doses of 
      suvorexant compared to placebo. Suvorexant 50 mg and 100 mg significantly decreased 
      latency to persistent sleep and wake after sleep onset time, and increased sleep 
      efficiency. Suvorexant 10 mg significantly decreased wake after sleep onset time. 
      There were no statistically significant effects of suvorexant on EEG frequency bands 
      including delta (slow wave) activity based on power spectral analysis. Suvorexant 
      was well tolerated. There was no evidence of next-day residual effects for 
      suvorexant 10 mg. Suvorexant 50 mg statistically significantly reduced subjective 
      alertness, and suvorexant 100 mg significantly increased reaction time and reduced 
      subjective alertness. There were no statistically significant effects of any 
      suvorexant dose on digit symbol substitution test performance. In Period 5, plasma 
      samples of suvorexant were collected for pharmacokinetic evaluation. The median 
      T(max) was 3 hours and apparent terminal t(½) was 9-13 hours. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      healthy young men without sleep disorders, suvorexant promoted sleep with some 
      evidence of residual effects at the highest doses.

TI  - Withdrawal of anti-epileptic medications during video EEG monitoring does not alter 
      ECG parameters or HRV.

LID - S0920-1211(13)00105-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2013.04.003 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess if anti-epileptic drug (AED) withdrawal/cessation results in 
      changes in ECG parameters and/or measures of heart rate variability (HRV), in 
      patients having VEEG monitoring, that might affect susceptibility to sudden death in 
      epilepsy. METHODS: In this study, we included 36 patients with medically refractory 
      epilepsy undergoing continuous video-EEG-ECG monitoring in hospital for pre-surgical 
      assessment. We recorded and analysed multiple 10-min epochs of 2-lead ECG during 
      periods when the subjects were awake and in REM and non-REM sleep, both on 
      admission, and after the subjects had been partially or completely weaned from their 
      AEDs. We compared ECG parameters and measures of HRV from these recorded epochs 
      before and after AED reduction/cessation, with each patient acting as their own 
      comparator. Epochs measured during awake, REM, and non-REM periods were analysed 
      separately. In addition, we analysed a subgroup of patients who had been withdrawn 
      from Na+-channel blocking medications specifically, to analyse the effect of this 
      particular class of AEDs in isolation. KEY FINDINGS: Upon AED withdrawal, we 
      observed a small increase in heart rate and shortening of the QT interval, when 
      subjects were awake, but no other changes in ECG parameters were detected, nor did 
      we find changes in any measure of HRV. In addition, no significant changes were 
      found during sleep. Similar results were found in the analysis of the subgroup of 
      patients withdrawn from Na+-channel blocking AEDs. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study does not 
      support a prominent role for AEDs, and withdrawal/cessation of AEDs, in deranging 
      cardiac physiology during video EEG monitoring in medically refractory epilepsy 
      patients undergoing video EEG monitoring.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the spectra of sleep profile using PSG in a cohort of patients 
      with JME attending a University hospital. METHODOLOGY: This prospective 
      cross-sectional case-control study involved 25 patients of JME (age: 22.0±6.3 years; 
      M:F=13:12) on valproic acid (VPA) and 25 matched healthy controls (age: 23.2±3.04 
      years; M:F=16:9) were recruited. All patients underwent clinical assessment, 
      electroencephalogram (EEG), and evaluation with sleep questionnaire and PSG. 
      RESULTS: PSG analysis revealed significant alterations in sleep architecture in the 
      JME group in the form of reduced mean sleep efficiency (p=<0.035) and number of 
      patients with reduced sleep efficiency (p=0.001), increased mean sleep onset latency 
      (p=0.04) and number of patients with increased sleep latency (p=0.023), reduced mean 
      N2 sleep percentage (p=0.005) and reduced mean total NREM (non-rapid eye movement) 
      sleep (p=0.001) and increased mean wake percentage (p=0.001). The frequency of 
      arousals, involuntary limb movements, and event related arousals in the JME groups 
      was not different from the controls. Patients >20 years had reduced total sleep time 
      compared to those <20 years (p=0.012). Patients with seizures for >5 years had 
      reduced NREM sleep percentage (p=0.042) and those on VPA therapy >1 year had a 
      longer stage 2 (p=0.03) and N3 latency (p=0.03). Patients on ≤600mg/day of VPA had a 
      higher prevalence of isolated limb movements (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PSG revealed 
      significant alterations in sleep architecture in JME despite adequate seizure 
      control. There was variable degree of PSG-phenotypic correlation.

AB  - We report a boy, referred at 25 months following a dramatic isolated language 
      regression antedating autistic-like symptomatology. His sleep electroencephalogram 
      (EEG) showed persistent focal epileptiform activity over the left parietal and 
      vertex areas never associated with clinical seizures. He was started on 
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) with a significant improvement in language, 
      behavior, and in EEG discharges in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Later course was 
      characterized by fluctuations/regressions in language and behavior abilities, in 
      phase with recrudescence of EEG abnormalities prompting additional ACTH courses that 
      led to remarkable decrease in EEG abnormalities, improvement in language, and to a 
      lesser degree, in autistic behavior. The timely documentation of regression episodes 
      suggesting an "atypical" autistic regression, striking therapy-induced improvement, 
      fluctuation of symptomatology over time could be ascribed to recurrent and 
      persisting EEG abnormalities.

TI  - [Diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy and narcolepsy comorbid].
PG  - 676-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical diagnosis and treatment process of narcolepsy and 
      epilepsy co-existence, and thereby to improve awareness of such cases. METHOD: The 
      clinical manifestations of 2 cases were observed, and video-electroencephalogram 
      (VEEG), multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) were performed. Hypocretin 1 level in 
      cerebrospinal fluid was examined in one case. RESULT: The onset of disease of case 
      one was started with epilepsy with myoclonic seizure. After half a year, catalepsy 
      induced by emotion especially laughing and excessive daytime sleepiness appeared. 
      MSLT was positive and hypocretin 1 level decreased. Narcolepsy-cataplexy was 
      definitely diagnosed in this case. Valproate was given and seizure was controlled 
      completely, but the excessive daytime sleepiness was aggravated. Combination of 
      valproate, methylphenidate and clomipramine treatment improved the symptoms of 
      narcolepsy and the patient was still free of epileptic seizures. The onset symptoms 
      of case 2 were catalepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness. MSLT was positive. The 
      treatment was ineffective because of bad compliance. After 2 years, episodes of 
      impairment of consciousness with automatism occurred. VEEG showed slow waves and 
      spikes in right temporal area. Complex partial seizure was determined. Oxcarbazepine 
      was used and then the patients became seizures free, but the symptoms of narcolepsy 
      were still obvious. CONCLUSION: Comorbidity of narcolepsy and epilepsy is a rare 
      phenomenon. Clinical symptoms, predisposing factor, VEEG and MSLT can help diagnosis 
      and differential diagnosis. The antiepileptic drugs might aggravate drowsiness. 
      Based on therapy of epilepsy by using antiepileptic drugs, low dosage of central 
      nervous system stimulants might improve the drowsiness and catalepsy symptoms of 
      narcolepsy.

TI  - [10 years, 600 monitoring sessions--our experience with the video EEG monitoring of 
      children].
PG  - 107-14
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The only Hungarian video EEG laboratory where children of ages 0-18 
      can be continuously monitored for several days was opened 1 June 2001 at Department 
      of Neurology of Bethesda Children's Hospital. OBJECTIVES: Summarizing our 10 years 
      of experience with the video EEG monitoring (VEM) of children and defining the place 
      of VEM in the treatment of childhood epilepsy in Hungary. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We 
      have processed data from 597 monitoring sessions on 541 patients between June 1, 
      2001 and 31 May, 2011 based on our database and the detailed summaries of the 
      procedures. RESULTS: 509 patients were under the age of 18. The average length of 
      the sessions was 3.1 days. We have observed habitual episodes or episodes in 
      question in 477 (80%) sessions. 241 (40%) sessions were requested with an epilepsy 
      surgery indication, and 74 patients had 84 operations. 356 (60%) were requested with 
      a differential diagnosis indication, and 191 (53%) cases of epilepsy were diagnosed. 
      We most commonly diagnosed symptomatic generalized epilepsy (57 cases). In 165 
      sessions the episode in question was not diagnosed as epilepsy. Among the paroxysmal 
      episodes we have identified events of psychogenic origin, movement disorders, sleep 
      disorders and behavioral disorders. Only 3% of the differential diagnosis procedures 
      brought no additional clinical information. DISCUSSION: The diagnostic efficiency in 
      our VEM laboratory is in accordance with the data found in the literature. Besides 
      epilepsy surgery VEM is recommended if suspected epileptic episodes occur and 
      interictal epileptiform signs are not present or are not in accordance with the 
      symptoms, if there is no explanation for therapy resistance and if paroxysmal 
      episodes of non-epileptic origin are suspected but they cannot be identified based 
      on the anamnesis. VEM is also helpful in diagnosing subtle seizures. The procedure 
      has numerous additional benefits in patient care and in training the parents and 
      hospital staff.

TI  - Assessing the effects of electroconvulsive therapy on cortical excitability by means 
      of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography.
PG  - 326-37

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has significant short-term antidepressant effects on 
      drug-resistant patients with severe major depression. Animal studies have 
      demonstrated that electroconvulsive seizures produce potentiation-like synaptic 
      remodeling in both sub-cortical and frontal cortical circuits. However, the 
      electrophysiological effects of ECT in the human brain are not known. In this work, 
      we evaluated whether ECT induces a measurable change in the excitability of frontal 
      cortical circuits in humans. Electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials evoked by 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were collected before and after a course of 
      ECT in eight patients with severe major depression. Cortical excitability was 
      measured from the early and local EEG response to TMS. Clinical assessment confirmed 
      the beneficial effects of ECT on depressive symptoms at the group level. TMS/EEG 
      measurements revealed a clear-cut increase of frontal cortical excitability after 
      ECT as compared to baseline, that was significant in each and every patient. The 
      present findings corroborate in humans the idea that ECT may produce synaptic 
      potentiation, as previously observed in animal studies. Moreover, results suggest 
      that TMS/EEG may be employed in depressed patients to monitor longitudinally the 
      electrophysiological effects of different therapeutic neuromodulators, e.g. ECT, 
      repetitive TMS, and sleep deprivation. To the extent that depression involves an 
      alteration of frontal cortical excitability, these measurements may be used to guide 
      and evaluate treatment progression over time at the single-patient level.

TI  - EEG biomarkers in major depressive disorder: discriminative power and prediction of 
      treatment response.
PG  - 604-18
LID - 10.3109/09540261.2013.816269 [doi]
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) has high population prevalence and is associated 
      with substantial impact on quality of life, not least due to an unsatisfactory time 
      span of sometimes several weeks from initiation of treatment to clinical response. 
      Therefore extensive research focused on the identification of cost-effective and 
      widely available electroencephalogram (EEG)-based biomarkers that not only allow 
      distinguishing between patients and healthy controls but also have predictive value 
      for treatment response for a variety of treatments. In this comprehensive overview 
      on EEG research on MDD, biomarkers that are either assessed at baseline or during 
      the early course of treatment and are helpful in discriminating patients from 
      healthy controls and assist in predicting treatment outcome are reviewed, covering 
      recent decades up to now. Reviewed markers include quantitative EEG (QEEG) measures, 
      connectivity measures, EEG vigilance-based measures, sleep-EEG-related measures and 
      event-related potentials (ERPs). Further, the value and limitations of these 
      different markers are discussed. Finally, the need for integrated models of brain 
      function and the necessity for standardized procedures in EEG biomarker research are 
      highlighted to enhance future research in this field.

TI  - Neuronal activity in the preoptic hypothalamus during sleep deprivation and recovery 
      sleep.
PG  - 287-99
LID - 10.1152/jn.00504.2013 [doi]
AB  - The preoptic hypothalamus is implicated in sleep regulation. Neurons in the median 
      preoptic nucleus (MnPO) and the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) have been 
      identified as potential sleep regulatory elements. However, the extent to which MnPO 
      and VLPO neurons are activated in response to changing homeostatic sleep regulatory 
      demands is unresolved. To address this question, we continuously recorded the 
      extracellular activity of neurons in the rat MnPO, VLPO and dorsal lateral preoptic 
      area (LPO) during baseline sleep and waking, during 2 h of sleep deprivation (SD) 
      and during 2 h of recovery sleep (RS). Sleep-active neurons in the MnPO (n = 11) and 
      VLPO (n = 13) were activated in response to SD, such that waking discharge rates 
      increased by 95.8 ± 29.5% and 59.4 ± 17.3%, respectively, above waking baseline 
      values. During RS, non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep discharge rates of MnPO 
      neurons initially increased to 65.6 ± 15.2% above baseline values, then declined to 
      baseline levels in association with decreases in EEG delta power. Increase in 
      non-REM sleep discharge rates in VLPO neurons during RS averaged 40.5 ± 7.6% above 
      baseline. REM-active neurons (n = 16) in the LPO also exhibited increased waking 
      discharge during SD and an increase in non-REM discharge during RS. Infusion of A2A 
      adenosine receptor antagonist into the VLPO attenuated SD-induced increases in 
      neuronal discharge. Populations of LPO wake/REM-active and state-indifferent neurons 
      and dorsal LPO sleep-active neurons were unresponsive to SD. These findings support 
      the hypothesis that sleep-active neurons in the MnPO and VLPO, and REM-active 
      neurons in the LPO, are components of neuronal circuits that mediate homeostatic 
      responses to sustained wakefulness.

TI  - Postictal generalized EEG suppression is not associated with periictal cardiac 
      autonomic instability in people with convulsive seizures.
PG  - 523-9
LID - 10.1111/epi.12021 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) seems to be a pathophysiologic 
      hallmark in ictal recordings of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). It has 
      recently been suggested that presence and duration of PGES might be a predictor of 
      SUDEP risk. Little is known about the etiology of PGES. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective case-control study in 50 people with convulsive seizures (CS) recorded 
      on digital video-electroencephalography (EEG). One CS per individual was reviewed 
      for presence and duration of PGES by two independent observers: Preictal and 
      postictal heart rate (HR) (1 min before seizure onset and 1, 3, 5, 15, and 30 min 
      after seizure end) and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV), 
      including the ratio of low frequency (LF) versus high frequency (HF) power, were 
      analyzed. The relationship between PGES and periictal autonomic changes was 
      evaluated, as well as its association with several clinical variables. KEY FINDINGS: 
      Thirty-seven individuals (74%) exhibited PGES and 13 (26%) did not. CS resulted in a 
      significant increase of periictal HR and the LF/HF ratio. PGES was associated with 
      neither periictal HR (mean HR difference between PGES+ and PGES- seizures: -2 beats 
      per minute [bpm], 95% confidence interval [CI] -10 to +6 bpm) nor HRV change. There 
      was no association between the duration of PGES and periictal HR change. People with 
      PGES were more likely to be asleep before seizure onset (odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95% CI 
      1.2-18.3) and had a higher age of onset of epilepsy (median age 15 vs. 4 years). 
      SIGNIFICANCE: PGES was not associated with substantial changes in measures of 
      cardiac autonomic instability but was more prevalent in CS arising from sleep.

AB  - Up to 13% of patients with epilepsy have moderate or severe sleep-disordered 
      breathing, in particular obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a disorder associated with 
      reduced quality of life, worsened seizure control, and increased cardiovascular 
      morbidity and mortality. Combining video-EEG monitoring with polysomnography (VPSG) 
      provides the opportunity to diagnose clinically significant OSA as well as relate 
      the occurrence of seizures and the epilepsy diagnosis to the presence and severity 
      of sleep-disordered breathing. We have established routine VPSG in our inpatient 
      video-EEG monitoring unit and present our findings in 87 patients. Clinically 
      significant sleep-disordered breathing was diagnosed in 19 of 87 (22%) patients. 
      Patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) had poorer sleep quality 
      compared to patients with epilepsy and those with neither diagnosis, whereas the 
      prevalence of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing in patients with 
      PNES (29%) did not differ significantly compared to patients with epilepsy (21%) and 
      those with neither diagnosis (22%). The differences in sleep quality are not 
      explained by differences in body mass index (BMI) or anti-epileptic drug (AED) 
      effects.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the regulation of sleep. The 
      perifornical-lateral hypothalamic area (PF-LHA) is a key wake-promoting region and 
      contains neurons that are active during behavioral or cortical activation. Recently, 
      we found higher levels of NO metabolites (NOx), an indirect measure of NO levels, in 
      the PF-LHA during prolonged waking (SD). However, NO is highly reactive and diffuses 
      rapidly and the NOx assay is not sensitive enough to detect rapid-changes in NO 
      levels across spontaneous sleep-waking states. We used a novel Nafion®-modified 
      Platinum (NF-PT) electrode for real-time detection of NO levels in the PF-LHA across 
      sleep-wake cycles, dark-light phases, and during SD. Sprague-Dawley male rats were 
      surgically prepared for chronic sleep-wake recording and implantation of NF-PT 
      electrode into the PF-LHA. Electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and 
      electrochemical current generated by NF-PT electrode were continuously acquired for 
      5-7days including one day with 3h of SD. In the PF-LHA, NO levels exhibited a 
      waking>rapid eye movement (REM)>non-rapid eye movement (nonREM) sleep pattern 
      (0.56±0.03μM>0.47±0.02μM>0.42±0.02μM; p<0.01). NO levels were also higher during the 
      dark- as compared to the light-phase (0.53±0.03μM vs. 0.44±0.02μM; p<0.01). NO 
      levels increased during 3h of SD as compared to undisturbed control (0.58±0.04μM vs. 
      0.47±0.01μM; p<0.05). The findings indicate that in the PF-LHA, NO is produced 
      during behavioral or cortical activation. Since elevated levels of NO inhibits most 
      of the PF-LHA neurons that are active during cortical activation, these findings 
      support a hypothesis that NO produced in conjunction with the activation of PF-LHA 
      neurons during waking/SD, inhibits the same neuronal population to promote sleep.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate clinical characteristics associated with wicket spikes in 
      patients undergoing long-term video-EEG monitoring. METHODS: A case-control study 
      was performed in 479 patients undergoing video-EEG monitoring, with 3 age- (±3 
      years) and gender-matched controls per patient with wicket spikes. Logistic 
      regression was utilized to investigate the association between wicket spikes and 
      other factors, including conditions that have been previously associated with wicket 
      spikes. RESULTS: Wicket spikes were recorded in 48 patients. There was a 
      significantly higher prevalence of dizziness/vertigo (p=0.002), headaches (p=0.005), 
      migraine (p=0.015), and seizures (p=0.016) in patients with wickets. The majority of 
      patients with wicket spikes did not exhibit epileptiform activity on EEG; however, 
      patients with history of seizures were more likely to have wickets (p=0.017). There 
      was no significant difference in the prevalence of psychogenic non-epileptic 
      seizures between the groups. Wickets were more common on the left, during sleep, and 
      more likely to be first recorded on day 1-2 of monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Patients 
      with wicket spikes are more likely to have dizziness/vertigo, headaches, migraine, 
      and seizures. Patients with history of seizures are more likely to have wickets. The 
      prevalence of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures is not significantly higher in 
      patients with wickets.

AB  - Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe 
      neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes 
      that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. mTOR exists 
      within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). 
      Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As 
      the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to neural development and homeostasis 
      has not been well studied, we generated a conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a 
      key component of mTORC2. mTORC2 signaling is impaired in the brain, whereas mTORC1 
      signaling is unchanged. Rictor CKO mice have small brains and bodies, normal 
      lifespan and are fertile. Cortical layering is normal, but neurons are smaller than 
      those in control brains. Seizures were not observed, although excessive slow 
      activity was seen on electroencephalography. Rictor CKO mice are hyperactive and 
      have reduced anxiety-like behavior. Finally, there is decreased white matter and 
      increased levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the cerebral cortex. Loss of 
      mTORC2 signaling in the cortex independent of mTORC1 can disrupt normal brain 
      development and function and may contribute to some of the neurologic manifestations 
      seen in TSC.

AB  - Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a recognizable, frequent epileptic syndrome. 
      The most typical ictal phenomenon is bilateral myoclonia without loss of 
      consciousness (M), with most patients also presenting with generalized tonic-clonic 
      seizures (GTCSs) and some with absence seizures (ASs). The most striking features of 
      JME are its onset around the time of puberty and the fact that seizure episodes 
      occur after awakening from a sleep period or in the evening relaxation period and 
      are facilitated by sleep deprivation and sudden arousal. Photic sensitivity is 
      common in the EEG laboratory but uncommon or unrecognized in daily life. The 
      clinical features of JME make it easy to diagnose. In recent years, awareness of JME 
      has increased, and patients are often accurately diagnosed clinically before 
      confirmation by EEG. The typical circumstance at diagnosis is a first GTCS episode, 
      and one learns during the interview that the patient has had M in the morning for 
      some time before the GTCS episode. There are only few differential diagnoses: the 
      adolescent-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsies, or other forms of idiopathic 
      generalized epilepsies of adolescence. With JME being so common, we propose that a 
      first GTCS episode in a teenager should be considered as revealing JME until proven 
      otherwise.

AB  - Idiopathic rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) has been found to 
      be a strong early predictor for later development into Parkinson's disease (PD). 
      iRBD is diagnosed by polysomnography but the manual evaluation is laborious, why the 
      aims of this study are to develop supportive methods for detecting iRBD from 
      electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) signals recorded during REM sleep. This method 
      classified subjects from their EEG similarity with the two classes iRBD patients and 
      control subjects. The feature sets used for classifying subjects were based on the 
      relative powers of the EEG signals in different frequency bands. The classification 
      was based on the fast and classical K-means and Bayesian classifiers. With a 
      subject-specific re-scaling of the feature set and the use of a Bayesian classifier 
      the performance reached 90% in both sensitivity and specificity. For the purpose of 
      reducing the feature count, the features were evaluated with the statistical 
      Smith-Satterthwaite test and by using sequential forward selection a well-performing 
      feature subset was found which contained only five features, while attaining a 
      sensitivity and a specificity of both 80 %.

AB  - This study investigates the ERP components associated with the processing of words 
      that are critical to generating and rejecting deductive conditional Modus Ponens 
      arguments (If P then Q; P//Therefore, Q). The generation of a logical inference is 
      investigated by placing a verb in the minor premise that matches the one used in the 
      antecedent of the conditional premise so that the inference can be carried out (If 
      John is sleeping then he is snoring; John is sleeping). Rejections are examined by 
      placing verbs that are associates of the verb that would make the conclusion valid 
      (Conclusion 'therefore John is dreaming' in the example above). The inference 
      generation phase was characterized by two ERP components, namely the P3b and the 
      PSW. Rejections were associated with an N2 and a late positive component. The 
      implications of these results regarding the processing of words in an inferential 
      context are discussed.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the usefulness of EEG in the diagnosis of lissencephaly, a rare 
      cortical developmental disorder associated with abnormal cellular proliferation. 
      Currently, the clinical emphasis is placed on the radiological and genetic aspects 
      for the diagnosis of lissencephaly. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 
      consecutive EEG recordings and imaging data from 14 children, with the diagnosis of 
      lissencephaly, who were admitted from January 1998 to January 2010. All EEG 
      recordings were performed with the 10-20 system of electrode placement, in both 
      awake and sleep states. All EEG recordings were reviewed using anterior-posterior 
      bipolar and transverse montages and then they were interpreted blindly, with respect 
      to the imaging and genetic investigations for each patient. RESULTS: All children 
      showed one of the three characteristic EEG patterns reported in the literature of 
      lissencephaly. The EEG pattern I, showed an anterior posterior gradient that 
      corresponded to the severity of the imaging study abnormality. All patients were on 
      two or more AEDs and reported to continue having active epilepsy. CONCLUSION: In a 
      child with clinical characteristics of lissencephaly, one of these three reported 
      EEG patterns can prove useful in making the diagnosis very probable, preceding 
      imaging and genetic testing.

AB  - How rhythms are generated by neuronal networks is fundamental to understand rhythmic 
      behaviors such as respiration, locomotion, and mastication. Respiratory rhythm is 
      generated by the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), an anatomically and functionally 
      discrete population of brainstem neurons, central and necessary for respiratory 
      rhythm. In specific in vitro conditions, preBötC neurons depend on voltage-dependent 
      inward currents to generate respiratory rhythm. In the mature and intact organism, 
      where preBötC neurons are deeply embedded in the respiratory network, the 
      contribution of ionic currents to respiratory rhythm is unclear. We propose that a 
      set of ionic currents plays a key role in generating respiratory rhythm in the 
      mature organism in vivo. By microperfusing ionic current blockers into the preBötC 
      of adult rats, we identify the hyperpolarization-activated cation current as a 
      critical component of the mechanism promoting respiratory rhythm, and that this 
      current, in combination with the persistent sodium current, is essential to 
      respiratory rhythm in vivo. Importantly, both currents contribute to rhythmic 
      activity in states of anesthesia, quiet wakefulness, and sleep, but not when the 
      organism is engaged in active behaviors. These data show that a set of ionic 
      currents at the preBötC imparts the network with rhythmicity in reduced states of 
      arousal, although the network can override their contribution to adjust its activity 
      for nonrhythmic behaviors in active wakefulness.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical, electroencephalographic and 
      polysomnographic features of patients presenting with parasomnias. Cases who were 
      admitted for differentiating parasomnias from epilepsy were included in the study. 
      Clinical features of cases were recorded and routine sleep electroencephalography 
      was obtained from all cases. Cases whose symptoms strongly suggested nocturnal 
      seizure underwent all night video electroencephalography monitoring. Polysomnography 
      was obtained to evaluate the quality of breathing from patients whose symptoms 
      suggested obstructive sleep apnea. Twenty-three patients with no neurological 
      disorder were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 11.7 ± 2.8 
      [7-17] years. Twelve patients (52 %) presented with sleep terrors and 11 patients 
      (48 %) presented with sleep walking. All of the patients underwent a routine sleep 
      electroencephalographic study and 15 patients (65 %) whose symptoms strongly 
      suggested nocturnal epilepsy underwent long-term video electroencephalographic 
      evaluation. Ten patients (43 %) underwent polysomnographic study. Three patients (20 
      %) who underwent long-term video electroencephalographic evaluation were diagnosed 
      to have nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and two patients (20 %) who underwent 
      polysomnography had pathological sleep apnea. Eleven patients (48 %) had a 
      psychiatric disorder like major depression, anxiety disorder, hyperactivity disorder 
      and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Childhood cases presenting with parasomnias 
      should be searched for nocturnal epileptic disorders, sleep disordered breathing and 
      psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian hypothalamus contains a circadian 
      clock for timing of diverse neuronal, endocrine, and behavioral rhythms, such as the 
      cycle of sleep and wakefulness. Using extracellular single unit recordings, we have 
      determined, for the first time, the discharge activity of individual SCN neurons 
      during the complete wake-sleep cycle in non-anesthetized, head restrained mice. SCN 
      neurons (n=79) were divided into three types according to their regular (type I; 
      n=38) or irregular (type II; n=19) discharge activity throughout the wake-sleep 
      cycle or their quiescent activity during waking and irregular discharge activity 
      during sleep (type III; n=22). The type I and II neurons displayed a long-duration 
      action potential, while the type III neurons displayed either a short-duration or 
      long-duration action potential. The type I neurons discharged exclusively as single 
      isolated spikes, whereas the type II and III neurons fired as single isolated 
      spikes, clusters, or bursts. The type I and II neurons showed wake-active, 
      wake/paradoxical (or rapid eye movement) sleep-active, or state-unrelated activity 
      profiles and were, respectively, mainly located in the ventral or dorsal region of 
      the SCN. In contrast, the type III neurons displayed sleep-active discharge profiles 
      and were mainly located in the lateral region of the SCN. The majority of type I and 
      II neurons tested showed an increase in discharge rate following application of 
      light to the animal's eyes. Of the 289 extra-SCN neurons recorded, those displaying 
      sleep-active discharge profiles were mainly located dorsal to the SCN, whereas those 
      displaying wake-active discharge profiles were mainly located lateral or 
      dorsolateral to the SCN. This study shows heterogeneity of mouse SCN and surrounding 
      anterior hypothalamic neurons and suggests differences in their topographic 
      organization and roles in mammalian circadian rhythms and the regulation of sleep 
      and wakefulness.

AB  - Epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) represent a group of severe epileptic disorders 
      associated with cognitive and behavioral disturbances. The mechanisms of cognitive 
      disability in EEs remain unclear. This review summarized neuroimaging studies that 
      have tried to describe specific fingerprints of brain activation in EE. Although the 
      epileptic activity can be generated individually in different brain regions, it 
      seems likely that the activity propagates in a syndrome-specific way. In some EEs, 
      the epileptiform discharges were associated with an interruption of activity in the 
      default mode network. In another EE, other mechanisms seem to underlie cognitive 
      disability associated with epileptic activity, for example, abnormal connectivity 
      pattern or interfering activity in the thalamocortical network. Further neuroimaging 
      studies are needed to investigate the short-term and long-term impact of epileptic 
      activity on cognition and development.

AB  - Bipolar disorder is a neuropsychiatric disease characterized by states of mania with 
      or without depression. Pharmacological treatments can be inadequate at regulating 
      mood for many individuals. Melatonin therapy and aerobic exercise are independent 
      prospective therapies for bipolar disorder that have shown potential as mood 
      stabilizers in humans. Myshkin mice (Myk/+) carry a heterozygous missense mutation 
      in the neuronal Na(+),K(+)-ATPase α3 and model mania-related symptoms of bipolar 
      disorder including increased activity, risk-taking behavior and reductions in sleep. 
      One cohort of Myk/+ and wild-type littermates (+/+) was treated with melatonin and a 
      separate cohort was treated with voluntary exercise. Mania-related behavior was 
      assessed in both cohorts. The effect of melatonin on sleep and the effect of 
      exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus 
      were assayed. Melatonin and voluntary wheel running were both effective at reducing 
      mania-related behavior in Myk/+ but did not affect behavior in +/+. Melatonin 
      increased sleep in Myk/+ and did not change sleep in +/+. Myk/+ showed higher 
      baseline levels of BDNF protein in the hippocampus than +/+. Exercise increased BDNF 
      protein in +/+ hippocampus, while it did not significantly affect BDNF levels in 
      Myk/+ hippocampus. These findings support initial studies in humans indicating that 
      melatonin and exercise are useful independent adjunct therapies for bipolar 
      disorder. Their effects on mood regulation should be further examined in randomized 
      clinical trials. Our results also suggest that hippocampal BDNF may not mediate the 
      effects of exercise on mania-related behavior in the Myk/+ model of mania.

AB  - Atypical benign partial epilepsy (ABPE) is a subgroup among the idiopathic focal 
      epilepsies of childhood. Aim of this study was to investigate neuronal networks 
      underlying ABPE and compare the results with previous electroencephalography 
      (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of related epilepsy 
      syndromes. Ten patients with ABPE underwent simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording. In all 
      10 patients several types of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were 
      recorded. Individual IED-associated blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal 
      changes were analyzed in a single subject analysis for each IED type (33 studies). A 
      group analysis was also performed to determine common BOLD signal changes across the 
      patients. IED-associated BOLD signal changes were found in 31 studies. Focal BOLD 
      signal changes concordant with the spike field (21 studies) and distant cortical and 
      subcortical BOLD signal changes (31 studies) were detected. The group analysis 
      revealed a thalamic activation. This study demonstrated that ABPE is characterized 
      by patterns similar to studies in rolandic epilepsy (focal BOLD signal changes in 
      the spike field) as well as patterns observed in continuous spikes and waves during 
      slow sleep (CSWS) (distant BOLD signal changes in cortical and subcortical 
      structures), thereby underscoring that idiopathic focal epilepsies of childhood form 
      a spectrum of overlapping syndromes.

AB  - The goal of this study is to investigate functional connectivity between different 
      brain regions by analyzing the temporal relationship of the maxima of gamma waves 
      recorded in multiple brain areas. Local field potentials were recorded from motor 
      cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and piriform cortex of rats. Gamma activity 
      was filtered and separated into two bands; high (65-90Hz) and low (30-55Hz) gamma. 
      Maxima for gamma activity waves were detected and functional connectivity between 
      different brain regions was determined using Shannon entropy for perievent 
      histograms for each pair channels. Significant Shannon entropy values were reported 
      as connectivity factors. We defined a connectivity matrix based the connectivity 
      factors between different regions. We found that maxima of low and high frequency 
      gamma occur in strong temporal relationship between some brain areas, indicating the 
      existence of functional connections between these areas. The spatial pattern of 
      functional connections between brain areas was different for slow wave sleep and 
      waking states. However for each behavioral state in the same animal the pattern of 
      functional connections was stable over time within 30min of continuous analysis and 
      over a 5 day period. With the same electrode montage the pattern of functional 
      connectivity varied from one subject to another. Analysis of the temporal 
      relationship of maxima of gamma waves between various brain areas could be a useful 
      tool for investigation of functional connections between these brain areas. This 
      approach could be applied for analysis of functional alterations occurring in these 
      connections during different behavioral tasks and during processes related to 
      learning and memory. The specificity in the connectivity pattern from one subject to 
      another can be explained by the existence of unique functional networks for each 
      subject.

AB  - PURPOSE: Little is known about the effect of psychogenic non epileptic seizures 
      (PNES) to caregiver quality of life (QOL), particularly as it compares to epileptic 
      seizures (ES). We sought to characterize this effect and identify its determinants. 
      METHODS: The study population comprised of 126 ES and 33 PNES patients who underwent 
      video EEG monitoring along with 48 and 18 caregivers respectively who accompanied 
      them to their investigations. Patients completed questionnaires providing 
      demographic, disease-related, cognitive, psychiatric, sleep and QOL information on 
      admission, prior to their diagnosis being clarified. Their caregivers completed 
      questionnaires providing demographic, disease burden and generic QOL information. 
      Paraclinical data were also gathered. Regression analysis was used to identify 
      patient and caregiver related determinants of patient and caregiver QOL. RESULTS: 
      QOL scores were significantly worse for PNES than ES patients and were mainly linked 
      to depression levels. PNES and ES caregivers had comparable demographic 
      characteristics and QOL scores. ES caregiver QOL was better in employed caregivers 
      with lower burden scores for the physical component summary (PCS) and worse in 
      female caregivers of depressed patients with higher burden scores for the mental 
      component summary (MCS). Caregiver burden score was the strongest correlate of PNES 
      caregiver MCS QOL score. CONCLUSION: Caregiver QOL in PNES does not differ from 
      caregiver QOL in ES, while patient QOL is worse in PNES. Caregiver burden emerges as 
      a consistent correlate of caregiver QOL both in ES and PNES. These findings advocate 
      for consideration of caregiver burden and QOL in PNES in clinical practice and for 
      future research paradigms.

PG  - 1637-43

AB  - Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep correlates with neuronal activity in the brainstem, 
      basal forebrain and lateral hypothalamus. Lateral hypothalamus melanin-concentrating 
      hormone (MCH)-expressing neurons are active during sleep, but their effects on REM 
      sleep remain unclear. Using optogenetic tools in newly generated Tg(Pmch-cre) mice, 
      we found that acute activation of MCH neurons (ChETA, SSFO) at the onset of REM 
      sleep extended the duration of REM, but not non-REM, sleep episodes. In contrast, 
      their acute silencing (eNpHR3.0, archaerhodopsin) reduced the frequency and 
      amplitude of hippocampal theta rhythm without affecting REM sleep duration. In vitro 
      activation of MCH neuron terminals induced GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic 
      currents in wake-promoting histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus 
      (TMN), and in vivo activation of MCH neuron terminals in TMN or medial septum also 
      prolonged REM sleep episodes. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of 
      MCH neurons maintains REM sleep, possibly through inhibition of arousal circuits in 
      the mammalian brain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we examine the temporal connection between periodic leg 
      movements (PLMs) and cortical arousals, as well as the treatment effect of 
      pramipexole, in a clinical case with spinal cord lesion. METHODS: A patient with 
      complete cervical spinal cord injury and PLMs during sleep underwent two baseline 
      sleep recordings, one recording with dopaminergic treatment, and one recording with 
      adaptive servoventilation. RESULTS: The PLMs were temporally dissociated from 
      cortical arousals as well as from respiratory or heart rate events. PLMs were 
      suppressed by pramipexole and persisted after treatment of apnea. CONCLUSION: The 
      disconnection of PLMs from arousals supports a spinal generator or peripheral 
      trigger mechanism for PLMs. The suppression of movements by a dopamine agonist 
      suggests that its site of action is caudal to the cervical lesion and outside of the 
      brain. Our observation provides significant new knowledge about the pathogenesis of 
      PLMs and warrants studies in larger populations.

TI  - [ACTH therapy for two cases of epileptic spasms without hypsarrhythmia].
PG  - 58-61
AB  - We present two patients with epileptic spasms without hypsarrhythmia (ESWoH) who 
      were successfully treated with ACTH. One patient was an 18-month-old boy who had 
      normal development for the first 16 months of his life. Thereafter, he experienced 
      sudden flexion of the axial muscles, resulting in head nodings, or epileptic spasms 
      (ES). EEG tracings showed generalized polyspikes that appeared frequently during 
      sleep without associated hypsarrhythmia. We were thus able to diagnose him with 
      ESWoH and treated him with ACTH, which resolved his seizures. Another patient was a 
      7-year-old boy. At 18 months of age, the patient began to sufferdil from sudden ES. 
      Anti-epileptic drugs were administered individually and in combination but were 
      proved ineffective. Like the first case, this child's EEG tracing showed generalized 
      polyspikes during sleep without associated hypsarrhythmia. We diagnosed him with 
      ESWoH and treated him with ACTH. His ES disappeared soon after the initiation of 
      treatment. These two cases demonstrate the difficulty of treating ESWoH only with 
      standard anti-epileptic drugs, we emphasize the importance of early treatment with 
      ACTH.

AB  - Dream-enacting behaviors (DEBs) are behavioral expressions of forceful dream images 
      often occurring during sleep-to-wakefulness transitions. We propose that DEBs 
      reflect brain activity underlying social cognition, in particular, motor-affective 
      resonance generated by the mirror neuron system. We developed a Mirror Behavior 
      Questionnaire (MBQ) to assess some dimensions of mirror behaviors and investigated 
      relationships between MBQ scores and DEBs in a large of university undergraduate 
      cohort. MBQ scores were normally distributed and described by a four-factor 
      structure (Empathy/Emotional Contagion, Behavioral Imitation, Sleepiness/Anger 
      Contagion, Motor Skill Imitation). DEB scores correlated positively with MBQ total 
      and factor scores even with social desirability, somnambulism and somniloquy 
      controlled. Emotion-specific DEB items correlated with corresponding 
      emotion-specific MBQ items, especially crying and smiling. Results provide 
      preliminary evidence for cross-state relationships between propensities for 
      dream-enacting and mirror behaviors--especially behaviors involving motor-affective 
      resonance--and our suggestion that motor-affective resonance mediates 
      dream-enactment imagery during sleep and emotional empathy during waking.

TI  - Identification of insomnia in a sleep center population using electronic health data 
      sources and the insomnia severity index.
PG  - 655-60
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.2830 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the validity and efficacy of using electronic health 
      data to identify a physician diagnosis of insomnia in a population of patients 
      referred for testing at a tertiary sleep center. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study 
      in a tertiary sleep center in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Cohort consisted of 1,207 
      patients referred for sleep diagnostic testing and/or assessment by a sleep 
      physician. Two sleep physicians independently assigned each patient a primary sleep 
      diagnosis. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify variables that were 
      predictive for insomnia from online questionnaire and diagnostic testing data. 
      Diagnostic algorithms derived from these predictors and from the Insomnia Severity 
      Index were evaluated against physician diagnosis as a reference standard. RESULTS: 
      The combination of self-reported sleep latency > 20 minutes, total sleep time < 6.5 
      hours per night, the inability to fall asleep after waking, BMI < 27 kg/m(2), and 
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale score < 9 had very high specificity (99.3%) for diagnosing 
      insomnia; however, sensitivity was poor (11.8%). Other algorithms derived from these 
      data had either high sensitivity or high specificity. No combination of variables 
      yielded simultaneous high sensitivity and specificity. Likewise, the Insomnia 
      Severity Index can be highly sensitive or highly specific at identifying insomnia, 
      but not both. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic algorithms derived from electronic data can 
      provide high specificity or high sensitivity for identifying insomnia.

AB  - Herbal extracts targeting at the brain remain a continuous challenge to 
      pharmacology. Usually, a number of different animal tests have to be performed in 
      order to find a potential clinical use. Due to manifold possibly active ingredients 
      biochemical approaches are difficult. A more holistic approach using a 
      neurophysiological technique has been developed earlier in order to characterise 
      synthetic drugs. Stereotactic implantation of four semi-microelectrodes into frontal 
      cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation of rats allowed continuous 
      wireless monitoring of field potentials (EEG) before and after drug intake. After 
      frequency analysis (Fast Fourier Transformation) electric power was calculated for 6 
      ranges (delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1 and beta2). Data from 14 synthetic drugs 
      - tested earlier and representative for different clinical indications - were taken 
      for construction of discriminant functions showing the projection of the frequency 
      patterns in a six-dimensional graph. Quantitative analysis of the EEG frequency 
      pattern from the depth of the brain succeeded in discrimination of drug effects 
      according to their known clinical indication (Dimpfel and Schober, 2003). Extracts 
      from Valerian root, Ginkgo leaves, Paullinia seed, Hop strobile, Rhodiola rosea root 
      and Sideritis scardica herb were tested now under identical conditions. 
      Classification of these extracts based on the matrix from synthetic drugs revealed 
      that Valerian root and hop induced a pattern reminiscent of physiological sleep. 
      Ginkgo and Paullinia appeared in close neighbourhood of stimulatory drugs like 
      caffeine or to an analgesic profile (tramadol). Rhodiola and Sideritis developed 
      similar frequency patterns comparable to a psychostimulant drug (methylphenidate) as 
      well to an antidepressive drug (paroxetine).

TI  - Electroencephalogram paroxysmal θ characterizes cataplexy in mice and children.
PG  - 1592-608
LID - 10.1093/brain/awt069 [doi]
AB  - Astute control of brain activity states is critical for adaptive behaviours and 
      survival. In mammals and birds, electroencephalographic recordings reveal 
      alternating states of wakefulness, slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep (or rapid 
      eye movement sleep). This control is profoundly impaired in narcolepsy with 
      cataplexy, a disease resulting from the loss of orexin/hypocretin neurotransmitter 
      signalling in the brain. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is characterized by irresistible 
      bouts of sleep during the day, sleep fragmentation during the night and episodes of 
      cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone while awake and experiencing emotions. The 
      neural mechanisms underlying cataplexy are unknown, but commonly thought to involve 
      those of rapid eye movement-sleep atonia, and cataplexy typically is considered as a 
      rapid eye movement sleep disorder. Here we reassess cataplexy in hypocretin (Hcrt, 
      also known as orexin) gene knockout mice. Using a novel video/electroencephalogram 
      double-blind scoring method, we show that cataplexy is not a state per se, as 
      believed previously, but a dynamic, multi-phased process involving a reproducible 
      progression of states. A knockout-specific state and a stereotypical paroxysmal 
      event were introduced to account for signals and electroencephalogram spectral 
      characteristics not seen in wild-type littermates. Cataplexy almost invariably 
      started with a brief phase of wake-like electroencephalogram, followed by a phase 
      featuring high-amplitude irregular theta oscillations, defining an activity profile 
      distinct from paradoxical sleep, referred to as cataplexy-associated state and in 
      the course of which 1.5-2 s high-amplitude, highly regular, hypersynchronous 
      paroxysmal theta bursts (∼7 Hz) occurred. In contrast to cataplexy onset, exit from 
      cataplexy did not show a predictable sequence of activities. Altogether, these data 
      contradict the hypothesis that cataplexy is a state similar to paradoxical sleep, 
      even if long cataplexies may evolve into paradoxical sleep. Although not exclusive 
      to overt cataplexy, cataplexy-associated state and hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta 
      activities are highly enriched during cataplexy in hypocretin/orexin knockout mice. 
      Their occurrence in an independent narcolepsy mouse model, the orexin/ataxin 3 
      transgenic mouse, undergoing loss of orexin neurons, was confirmed. Importantly, we 
      document for the first time similar paroxysmal theta hypersynchronies (∼4 Hz) during 
      cataplexy in narcoleptic children. Lastly, we show by deep recordings in mice that 
      the cataplexy-associated state and hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta activities are 
      independent of hippocampal theta and involve the frontal cortex. Cataplexy 
      hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta bursts may represent medial prefrontal activity, 
      associated in humans and rodents with reward-driven motor impulse, planning and 
      conflict monitoring.

LID - e57394
AB  - Sleep has been shown to stabilize memory traces and to protect against competing 
      interference in both the procedural and declarative memory domain. Here, we focused 
      on an interference learning paradigm by testing patients with primary insomnia 
      (N = 27) and healthy control subjects (N = 21). In two separate experimental nights 
      with full polysomnography it was revealed that after morning interference procedural 
      memory performance (using a finger tapping task) was not impaired in insomnia 
      patients while declarative memory (word pair association) was decreased following 
      interference. More specifically, we demonstrate robust associations of central sleep 
      spindles (in N3) with motor memory susceptibility to interference as well as 
      (cortically more widespread) fast spindle associations with declarative memory 
      susceptibility. In general the results suggest that insufficient sleep quality does 
      not necessarily show up in worse overnight consolidation in insomnia but may only 
      become evident (in the declarative memory domain) when interference is imposed.

PG  - 751-5
LID - 10.1177/0883073813489732 [doi]
AB  - The International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group requires the presence of 
      encephalopathy to diagnose acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Clinical 
      characteristics of encephalopathy are inadequately delineated in the pediatric 
      demyelinating literature. The authors' purpose was to better define encephalopathy 
      in pediatric acute disseminated encephalomyelitis by describing the details of the 
      mental status change. A retrospective chart review was conducted for 25 children 
      diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis according to the International 
      Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group guidelines. Frequency of 
      encephalopathy-defining features was determined. Clinical characteristics, 
      cerebrospinal fluid findings, and electroencephalography (EEG) findings were 
      compared between patients with different stages of encephalopathy. The authors found 
      irritability (36%), sleepiness (52%), confusion (8%), obtundation (20%), and coma 
      (16%) as encephalopathy-defining features in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. 
      Twenty-eight percent had seizures, and 65% demonstrated generalized slowing on EEG. 
      Approximately half of the patients in this study were diagnosed with encephalopathy 
      based on the presence of irritability and/or sleepiness only. Such features in young 
      children are often subtle and transient and thus difficult to objectively determine.

TI  - Analysis of sleep disorders under pain using an optogenetic tool: possible 
      involvement of the activation of dorsal raphe nucleus-serotonergic neurons.
PG  - 59
LID - 10.1186/1756-6606-6-59 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several etiological reports have shown that chronic pain significantly 
      interferes with sleep. Inadequate sleep due to chronic pain may contribute to the 
      stressful negative consequences of living with pain. However, the neurophysiological 
      mechanism by which chronic pain affects sleep-arousal patterns is as yet unknown. 
      Although serotonin (5-HT) was proposed to be responsible for sleep regulation, 
      whether the activity of 5-HTergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is 
      affected by chronic pain has been studied only infrequently. On the other hand, the 
      recent development of optogenetic tools has provided a valuable opportunity to 
      regulate the activity in genetically targeted neural populations with high spatial 
      and temporal precision. In the present study, we investigated whether chronic pain 
      could induce sleep dysregulation while changing the activity of DRN-5-HTergic 
      neurons. Furthermore, we sought to physiologically activate the DRN with 
      channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to identify a causal role for the DRN-5-HT system in 
      promoting and maintaining wakefulness using optogenetics. RESULTS: We produced a 
      sciatic nerve ligation model by tying a tight ligature around approximately 
      one-third to one-half the diameter of the sciatic nerve. In mice with nerve 
      ligation, we confirmed an increase in wakefulness and a decrease in non-rapid eye 
      movement (NREM) sleep as monitored by electroencephalogram (EEG). Microinjection of 
      the retrograde tracer fluoro-gold (FG) into the prefrontal cortex (PFC) revealed 
      several retrogradely labeled-cells in the DRN. The key finding of the present study 
      was that the levels of 5-HT released in the PFC by the electrical stimulation of DRN 
      neurons were significantly increased in mice with sciatic nerve ligation. Using 
      optogenetic tools in mice, we found a causal relationship among DRN neuron firing, 
      cortical activity and sleep-to-wake transitions. In particular, the activation of 
      DRN-5-HTergic neurons produced a significant increase in wakefulness and a 
      significant decrease in NREM sleep. The duration of NREM sleep episodes was 
      significantly decreased during photostimulation in these mice. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest that neuropathic pain accelerates the activity of DRN-5-HTergic 
      neurons. Although further loss-of-function experiments are required, we hypothesize 
      that this activation in DRN neurons may, at least in part, correlate with sleep 
      dysregulation under a neuropathic pain-like state.

AB  - Angelman syndrome is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by the loss or reduction 
      of the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A enzyme. Angelman syndrome results from a 
      deletion or mutation of the maternally inherited 15q11.2-13.1 region, paternal 
      uniparental disomy of chromosome 15, or an imprinting error. Epilepsy is common and 
      may present with multiple seizure types, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus. 
      Seizures are often intractable and typically require broad-spectrum antiepileptic 
      medications. Dietary therapy has also proved successful in Angelman syndrome. 
      Electroencephalographic patterns include notched δ and rhythmic θ activity and 
      epileptiform discharges. Sleep disorders are also common, often characterized by 
      abnormal sleep-wake cycles. Movement disorders are nearly universal in Angelman 
      syndrome, most frequently presenting with ataxia and tremor. Neurocognitive 
      impairment is always present to varying degrees, and expressive speech is typically 
      severely affected. Individuals with Angelman syndrome often manifest psychiatric 
      comorbidities including hyperactivity, anxiety, and challenging behaviors such as 
      aggression and self-injury. We focus on a comprehensive whole-child approach to the 
      diagnosis and long-term clinical care of individuals with Angelman syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors of seizure recurrence and the most common 
      comorbidities in elderly patients with epilepsy. METHOD: We did a retrospective 
      study of 278 patients older than 65 years with first seizure. We evaluated 
      electrolytes, blood glucose, urea and creatinine levels, and performed 
      electrocardiography (ECG), and routine electroencephalogram (EEG) on all patients. 
      We evaluated seizure recurrence and comorbidities at 2 years. RESULTS: Univariate 
      analysis found that significant (P<0.05) factors affecting seizure recurrence were 
      etiology of seizure, EEG, and status epilepticus at first presentation. In 
      multivariate regression analysis, etiology of seizure and EEG were significant 
      statistical factors in seizure recurrence at 2 years follow up. Age, sex, duration 
      of time between first seizure and diagnosis of seizure, seizure type, misdiagnosis 
      of non-epileptic seizure, and use of antiepileptic drugs were not significant 
      factors for predicting seizure recurrence. Depression and anxiety were the most 
      common comorbidities in our study, followed by sleep-related disorders and stroke. 
      There were no statistically significantly differences in comorbidities between 
      patients who remained seizure free and patients who had recurrent seizure. 
      CONCLUSION: Most of the new onset seizures in our elderly patients were focal onset. 
      Acute symptomatic etiology, remote symptomatic etiology, progressive symptomatic 
      etiology and abnormal EEG features were powerful predictors of seizure recurrence, 
      and mood disorder, sleep disorder and stroke were the common comorbidities.

      of literature data.

AB  - We describe the EEG findings of an infant with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy 
      with mutation of the KCNQ2 gene and a family history of neonatal seizures. The 
      infant presented with multifocal drug-resistant seizures with onset during the third 
      day of life. Family history was positive for early-onset neonatal seizures. 
      Metabolic screening and neuroimaging were negative. Direct sequencing of KCQN2 from 
      both the mother and child revealed a heterozygous cytosine-to-guanine mutation 
      (Dedek et al., 2003). Interictal EEG showed a very discontinuous pattern which 
      evolved towards a defined burst-suppression pattern during sleep and a multifocal, 
      random, attenuation pattern during wakefulness. Focal, tonic seizures with head 
      deviation, sometimes followed by asynchronous and asymmetrical clonic jerks, eyelid 
      myoclonias, and polypnoea, were recorded. Ictal EEG was characterised by focal, 
      low-voltage, fast activity, followed by recruiting theta rhythms and bilateral, 
      focal, spike-wave complexes, alternatively localised to one hemisphere and 
      subsequently diffusing to the other. ACTH therapy was introduced, resulting in a 
      significant improvement in EEG activity and gradual reduction in seizure frequency, 
      with cessation at age 13 weeks. [Published with video sequences].

AB  - PURPOSE: The prognosis of first seizure in the elderly has rarely been studied. 
      Despite this, anti-epileptic drug treatment following first seizure is often 
      recommended in older adults due to the perception that recurrence is inevitable and 
      associated with significant morbidity. This study aims to establish whether older 
      patients presenting with first-ever seizure are more likely to have a second seizure 
      or not, and to examine their clinical features including seizure-related morbidity. 
      METHODS: Prospective observational study of adults seen by a hospital-based first 
      seizure service between 2000 and 2011. The prognosis and clinical features of older 
      (aged ≥65 years) and younger (aged 16-64 years) patients were compared. KEY 
      FINDINGS: 139 of 1008 patients with first-ever unprovoked seizure were aged ≥65 
      years (mean age 74 years). The majority of these older patients were healthy (95% 
      ambulant, 81% Rankin score ≤2). The likelihood of a second seizure at one year was 
      53% (95% CI 45-62) in older patients and 48% (95% CI 44-51) in younger patients. 
      Independent predictors of seizure recurrence were remote symptomatic etiology, first 
      seizure arising from sleep, epileptiform abnormality on EEG and partial seizures but 
      not age. Older patients were less likely to suffer a seizure-related injury with 
      both the presenting seizure and the first recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: With first-ever 
      seizure age is not an independent predictor of seizure recurrence and older patients 
      are less likely to sustain a seizure-related injury. Treatment decisions in older 
      patients presenting with first-ever seizure should be based on established risk 
      factors for seizure recurrence rather than age.

TI  - Video-EEG recordings in full-term neonates of diabetic mothers: observational study.
PG  - F493-8
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2013-304283 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether full-term newborn infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) 
      present immature/disorganised EEG patterns in the immediate neonatal period, and 
      whether there was any relationship with maternal glycaemic control. DESIGN AND 
      SETTING: Cohort study with an incidental sample performed in a tertiary hospital 
      neonatal unit. PATIENTS: 23 IDM and 22 healthy newborns born between 2010 and 2013. 
      INTERVENTIONS: All underwent video-EEG recording lasting >90 min at 48-72 h of life. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We analysed the percentage of indeterminate sleep, transient 
      sharp waves per hour and mature-for-gestational age EEG patterns (discontinuity, 
      maximum duration of interburst interval (IBI), asynchrony, asymmetry, δ brushes, 
      encoches frontales and α/θ rolandic activity). The group of IDM was divided into two 
      subgroups according to maternal HbA1c: (1) HbA1c≥6% and (2) HbA1c<6%. RESULTS: 
      Compared with healthy newborns, IDM presented significantly higher percentage of 
      indeterminate sleep (57% vs 25%; p<0.001), discontinuity (2.5% vs 0%; p=0.044) and δ 
      brushes in the bursts (6% vs 3%; p=0.024); higher duration of IBI (0.3 s vs 0 s; 
      p=0.017); fewer encoches frontales (7/h vs 35/h; p<0.001), reduced θ/α rolandic 
      activity (3/h vs 9/h; p<0.001); and more transient sharp waves (25/h vs 5/h; 
      p<0.001). IDM with maternal HbA1c≥6% showed greater percentage of δ brushes in the 
      burst (14% vs 4%; p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Full-term IDM newborns showed video-EEG 
      features of abnormal development of brain function. Maternal HbA1c levels<6% during 
      pregnancy could minimise the risk of cerebral dysmaturity.

TI  - Do seizures and epileptic activity worsen epilepsy and deteriorate cognitive 
      function?
PG  - 14-21
LID - 10.1111/epi.12418 [doi]
AB  - Relevant to the definition of epileptic encephalopathy (EE) is the concept that the 
      epileptic activity itself may contribute to bad outcomes, both in terms of epilepsy 
      and cognition, above and beyond what might be expected from the underlying pathology 
      alone, and that these can worsen over time. The review of the clinical and 
      experimental evidence that seizures or interictal electroencephalography (EEG) 
      discharges themselves can induce a progression toward more severe epilepsy and a 
      regression of brain function leads to the following conclusions: The possibility of 
      seizure-dependent worsening is by no means a general one but is limited to some 
      types of epilepsy, namely mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and EEs. Clinical and 
      experimental data concur in indicating that prolonged seizures/status epilepticus 
      (SE) are a risky initial event that can set in motion an epileptogenic process 
      leading to persistent, possibly drug-refractory epilepsies. The mechanisms for 
      SE-related epileptogenic process are incompletely known; they seem to involve 
      inflammation and/or glutamatergic transmission. The evidence of the role of 
      recurrent individual seizures in sustaining epilepsy progression is ambiguous. The 
      correlation between high seizure frequency and bad outcome does not necessarily 
      demonstrate a cause-effect relationship, rather high seizure frequency and bad 
      outcome can both depend on a particularly aggressive epileptogenic process. The 
      results of EE studies challenge the idea of a common seizure-dependent mechanism for 
      epilepsy progression/intellectual deterioration.

TI  - Ketamine, sleep, and depression: current status and new questions.
PG  - 394
LID - 10.1007/s11920-013-0394-z [doi]
AB  - Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has well-described 
      rapid antidepressant effects in clinical studies of individuals with 
      treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). Preclinical studies 
      investigating the effects of ketamine on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
      and on sleep slow wave activity (SWA) support its use as a prototype for 
      investigating the neuroplastic mechanisms presumably involved in the mechanism of 
      rapidly acting antidepressants. This review discusses human EEG slow wave sleep 
      parameters and plasma BDNF as central and peripheral surrogate markers of 
      plasticity, and their use in assessing ketamine's effects. Acutely, ketamine 
      elevates BDNF levels, as well as early night SWA and high-amplitude slow waves; each 
      of these measures correlates with change in mood in depressed patients who respond 
      to ketamine. The slow wave effects are limited to the first night post-infusion, 
      suggesting that their increase is part of an early cascade of events triggering 
      improved mood. Increased total sleep and decreased waking occur during the first and 
      second night post infusion, suggesting that these measures are associated with the 
      enduring treatment response observed with ketamine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleepwalking is typically a benign and self-limited non-rapid eye 
      movement parasomnia of childhood. PATIENT: We describe an unusual 15-year-old 
      boy referred to our sleep center for new-onset sleepwalking. RESULTS: An overnight 
      polysomnogram was normal from a respiratory standpoint, but a concurrent extended 
      electroencephalogram montage showed frequent epileptiform discharges from the right 
      parietal-temporal region and two electroclinical seizures arising from the 
      right-frontal-central-temporal region during sleep. Magnetic resonance imaging scan 
      revealed a right parasagittal parietal region lesion consistent with a low-grade 
      neoplasm, and surgical resection of the lesion demonstrated a right parietal 
      dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor. Complex partial seizures and sleepwalking 
      remitted completely with anticonvulsant therapy following surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      patient highlights the differential diagnosis of nocturnal events appearing to be 
      typical parasomnias, especially when they arise abruptly at an older age.

AB  - Structural and functional neuroimaging have substantively informed the 
      pathophysiology of numerous adult neurological and psychiatric disorders. While 
      structural neuroimaging is readily acquired in sedated young children, pediatric 
      application of functional neuroimaging has been limited by the behavioral demands of 
      in-scanner task performance. Here, we investigated whether functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) acquired during natural sleep and without experimental 
      stimulation offers a viable strategy for studying young children. We targeted the 
      lengthy epoch of non-rapid eye movement, stage 3 (NREM3) sleep typically observed at 
      sleep onset in sleep-deprived children. Seven healthy, preschool-aged children 
      (24-58 months) were studied, acquiring fMRI measurements of cerebral blood flow 
      (CBF) and of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), with concurrent sleep-stage 
      monitoring. ICN data (T2* fMRI) were reliably obtained during NREM3 sleep; CBF data 
      (arterial spin labeled fMRI) were not reliably obtained, as scanner noises disrupted 
      sleep. Applying independent component analysis (ICA) to T2* data, distinct ICNs were 
      observed which corresponded closely with those reported in the adult literature. 
      Notably, a network associated with orthography in adults was not observed, 
      suggesting that ICNs exhibit a developmental trajectory. We conclude that 
      resting-state fMRI obtained in sleep is a promising paradigm for neurophysiological 
      investigations of young children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a 
      well-documented risk factor for synucleinopathies such as Parkinson disease (PD) and 
      dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Moreover, approximately 50% of iRBD patients have 
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The purpose of our study was to investigate waking 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities specific to iRBD patients with MCI. 
      METHODS: Forty-two polysomnographically confirmed iRBD patients, including 23 iRBD 
      [+]MCI patients 19 patients without MCI (iRBD [-]MCI), and 37 healthy subjects 
      participated in the study. All participants underwent a complete neuropsychologic 
      assessment for MCI diagnosis and a waking quantitative EEG recording. RESULTS: iRBD 
      [+]MCI patients had a higher slow-to-fast frequency ratio than iRBD [-]MCI patients 
      and controls in the parietal, temporal, and occipital regions. iRBD [+]MCI patients 
      also had higher relative θ power in the parietal, temporal, and occipital regions 
      and lower relative α power in the occipital region compared to iRBD [-]MCI patients 
      and controls. Moreover, iRBD [+]MCI patients had higher relative θ power in the 
      frontal and central areas and lower relative β power in the central, parietal, and 
      temporal regions compared to controls. The dominant occipital frequency also was 
      slower in iRBD [+]MCI patients compared to controls. No between-group differences 
      were observed between iRBD [-]MCI patients and controls. CONCLUSION: In iRBD 
      patients, only those with concomitant MCI showed waking EEG slowing in the posterior 
      cortical regions, providing a potential marker for an increased risk for developing 
      DLB or PD.

TI  - Accuracy of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography in the prediction of 
      neurodevelopmental outcome in asphyxiated infants receiving hypothermia treatment.
PG  - 707-11
LID - 10.1111/apa.12226 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Both hypothermia and central nervous system (CNS) drugs may alter the 
      predictive accuracy of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) in 
      hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). The aim was to assess the predictive value 
      of aEEG in hypothermia-treated HIE infants. Furthermore, we intended to investigate 
      the association of cumulative doses of CNS drugs with aEEG recovery. METHODS: 
      Seventy term HIE infants treated with hypothermia for 72 h were continuously 
      monitored by single-channel aEEG. Doses of administered morphine, phenobarbitone and 
      midazolam were recorded. Poor outcome was defined as death or severe 
      neurodevelopmental delay at 18-24 months (Bayley Scales of Infant Development II), 
      good outcome as absence of these criteria. RESULTS: Poor outcome n = 26, good 
      outcome n = 44. Positive predictive values (PPV) of an abnormal background pattern 
      to predict poor outcome were 0.5 at 6 h; 0.65 at 24 h; 0.82 at 48 h and 0.92 at 60 
      h. All infants who developed sleep-wake cycling (SWC) had a favourable outcome; the 
      nondevelopment of SWC resulted in a PPV of 0.73 for a poor outcome. Cumulative doses 
      of the investigated drugs did not differ between infants having an onset of a 
      recovered background pattern before or after 24 h. CONCLUSION: Amplitude-integrated 
      electroencephalography provides reliable prediction of outcome from the 48th hour 
      during hypothermia in HIE infants. Commonly used CNS drugs in HIE infants do not 
      significantly delay aEEG recovery.

TI  - Glutamatergic function in the resting awake human brain is supported by uniformly 
      high oxidative energy.
PG  - 339-47
LID - 10.1038/jcbfm.2012.207 [doi]
AB  - Rodent (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies show that glutamatergic 
      signaling requires high oxidative energy in the awake resting state and allowed 
      calibration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal in terms of 
      energy relative to the resting energy. Here, we derived energy used for 
      glutamatergic signaling in the awake resting human. We analyzed human data of 
      electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) maps of oxygen 
      (CMR(O2)) and glucose (CMR(glc)) utilization, and calibrated fMRI from a variety of 
      experimental conditions. CMR(glc) and EEG in the visual cortex were tightly coupled 
      over several conditions, showing that the oxidative demand for signaling was four 
      times greater than the demand for nonsignaling events in the awake state. Variations 
      of CMR(O2) and CMR(glc) from gray-matter regions and networks were within ±10% of 
      means, suggesting that most areas required similar energy for ubiquitously high 
      resting activity. Human calibrated fMRI results suggest that changes of fMRI signal 
      in cognitive studies contribute at most ±10% CMR(O2) changes from rest. The PET data 
      of sleep, vegetative state, and anesthesia show metabolic reductions from rest, 
      uniformly >20% across, indicating no region is selectively reduced when 
      consciousness is lost. Future clinical investigations will benefit from using 
      quantitative metabolic measures.

AB  - Characterization of the electroclinical features and evolution of childhood 
      occipital epilepsy of Gastaut (COE-G). Seven children were retrospectively 
      identified as having COE-G and were followed-up clinically using EEGs. Visual 
      manifestations were the most common ictal event. Eye-associated ictal deviation was 
      associated with ipsilateral turning of the head and migraine-like symptoms were 
      frequent. Hemiconvulsions occurred in two children, and only one child had secondary 
      generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In all patients, seizures occurred while awake, 
      while two patients also had seizures while sleeping. EEG showed five patients with 
      occipital spike-wave discharges when their eyes were closed which disappeared once 
      their eyes were opened. Two cases continued having frequent seizures despite 
      antiepileptic drug treatment. These patients also displayed learning difficulties 
      and behavioral impairments after seizure onset. COE-G is a distinctive epileptic 
      syndrome; however, the long-term prognosis for patients with the condition is 
      unclear.

TI  - Establishment of a rabbit model of obstructive sleep apnea by paralyzing the 
      genioglossus.
PG  - 834-40
LID - 10.1001/jamaoto.2013.4001 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: This study presents an innovative method for developing a neuromuscular 
      model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OBJECTIVE: To establish a new OSA animal 
      model simulating real upper airway conditions during sleep. DESIGN AND SETTING: In 
      vivo animal study at an academic tertiary referral center. SUBJECTS: A total of 27 
      New Zealand white male rabbits were used. INTERVENTION: Sleep was induced by 
      intramuscular injection of 0.3 mL/kg of tiletamine hydrochloride plus zolazepam 
      hydrochloride and 0.2 mL/kg of xylazine. Upper airway obstruction was induced by 
      injecting botulinum toxin type A (2.5 U in 8 rabbits, 5.0 U in 10 rabbits, and 7.5 U 
      in 1 rabbit) into the genioglossus. Eight rabbits were injected with normal saline 
      as a control. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Drug-induced sleep was evaluated using a 
      portable polysomnography device for electroencephalography, electrooculography, chin 
      electromyography, nasal airflow, breathing efforts, and pulse oxymetry. Respiratory 
      events (apneas or hypopneas) during sleep were evaluated using a sleep-screening 
      tool. RESULTS: All the rabbits showed no apneas or hypopneas before injection of 
      botulinum toxin type A. In the control rabbits injected with normal saline, apneas 
      or hypopneas were not found. The respiratory events were observed in 5 of 8 rabbits 
      injected with 2.5 U of botulinum toxin type A, whereas they were observed in 7 of 10 
      rabbits injected with 5.0 U of botulinum toxin type A. The median (interquartile 
      range) apnea hypopnea index was 9.6 (5.3-14.8) per hour and 45.6 (21.5-70.5) per 
      hour in the rabbits injected with 2.5 U and 5.0 U of botulinum toxin type A, 
      respectively (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An animal model of OSA could be 
      developed by paralyzing the genioglossus in rabbits. This model may contribute to 
      identifying the pathogenesis of upper airway obstruction in OSA and to developing 
      new diagnostic or treatment devices targeting specific obstruction sites.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aim to analyze the fast oscillations in the scalp EEG of focal 
      epilepsy patients with low-to-high rates of interictal epileptiform discharges 
      (IEDs), in order to determine how this neurophysiological feature influences fast 
      oscillation occurrence and their significance as markers of the seizure onset zone 
      (SOZ). METHODS: Thirty-two patients were studied, subdivided in four categories 
      based on IED frequency: groups A, B and C respectively with high, intermediate and 
      low IED rate, and group D with no IED. Thirty minutes of slow-wave sleep EEG, 
      low-pass filtered at 300Hz and sampled at 1000Hz, were reviewed. IEDs and fast 
      oscillations (gamma activity, 40-80Hz; and ripples, >80Hz) were marked. Each channel 
      was classified as inside or outside the irritative zone and the SOZ. We calculated 
      the number and rates of IEDs and fast oscillation, their co-occurrence, their 
      frequency in the irritative zone and SOZ, and the specificity, sensitivity and 
      accuracy to determine the SOZ in the overall population and separately for each 
      group. RESULTS: We analyzed 984 channels. Group A (high IED rate) showed the highest 
      fast oscillation rate (gamma: 0.37±0.73; ripples: 0.17±0.26), followed by group B 
      (gamma: 0.08±0.06; ripples: 0.07±0.05), group C (gamma: 0.06±0.06; ripples: 
      0.04±0.01), and finally group D, with very low values (gamma: 0.03±0; ripples: 
      0.03±0). IEDs co-occurred with gamma in 9.5% and with ripples in 3.2%; and gamma and 
      ripples co-occurred with IEDs in 46.2% and 44.4%, respectively. The fast 
      oscillations were more frequent inside than outside the irritative zone and the SOZ 
      (p<0.001). Compared to the IEDs, the fast oscillations were less sensitive 
      (sensitivity: IEDs 78%, gamma 66% and ripples 48%) but more specific (specificity: 
      IEDs 50%, gamma 76% and ripples 83%) and accurate (accuracy: IEDs 54%, gamma 74% and 
      ripples 77%) in identifying the SOZ; the same results were reproduced for the 
      different groups separately. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that fast oscillations 
      can be recorded from the scalp EEG. Gamma activity and ripples are more frequent in 
      patients with frequent IEDs and, in general, inside the irritative zone. However, 
      compared to IEDs, gamma and ripples are less sensitive but more specific and 
      accurate in identifying the SOZ, and this remains in patients with low fast 
      oscillation rates. These findings suggest that IEDs and fast oscillations could 
      share some common neuronal network, but gamma activity and ripples are a better 
      biomarker of epileptogenicity.

AB  - Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a common form of epilepsy and a fairly lifelong 
      disorder that may significantly lower a patient's expectations and potential for a 
      full life. Luckily, it is also a highly treatable disorder, and up to 85% of 
      patients with JME will enjoy satisfactory seizure control. Among anticonvulsants, 
      valproate still stands out as the most efficacious drug, but may be poorly tolerated 
      by some, and is considered unsafe for the fetuses of pregnant women. Alternatives 
      have emerged in recent years, especially levetiracetam, but also topiramate, 
      zonisamide or lamotrigine. In some cases, combination therapy may be useful or even 
      required. One should not forget the potential aggravation induced not only by some 
      commonly used anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, but also, 
      in some patients, by lamotrigine. In special settings, older drugs like 
      benzodiazepines and barbiturates may be useful. But the management of JME should 
      also include intervention in lifestyle, with strict avoidance of sleep deprivation 
      and the management of copathologies, including the cognitive and psychiatric 
      problems that are often encountered. With adequate management, there will only 
      remain a small proportion of patients with uncontrolled epilepsy and all of its 
      related problems. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a condition in which the clinician 
      has a fair chance of significantly helping the patient with medication and 
      counseling.

AB  - PURPOSE: The role of EEG after a first seizure has been debated. Epileptiform EEG 
      activity is a good predictor of seizure recurrence, but is reported in only 8-50% of 
      first-seizure adult patients. Even if the EEG is abnormal, the opinions about 
      treatment after a first seizure differ. The role of EEG in treatment decisions after 
      remission or recurrence is also unclear. This study aims to identify neurologists' 
      diagnostic strategies compared to guidelines about the use of EEG (i) after a first 
      unprovoked generalized seizure in adults, (ii) after a recurrent seizure and (iii) 
      in treatment decisions after recurrence or remission. METHOD: All members of the 
      Dutch Neurological Society were invited to participate in our on-line survey about 
      the use of EEG after a first seizure, after recurrent seizures and in treatment 
      decisions. Ten percent (N=110) of invitees participated, including mainly clinical 
      neurophysiologists, general neurologists and neurologists-in-training. RESULTS: 
      Ninety-five percent of the respondents would request a routine EEG after a first 
      seizure. After normal MRI and EEG findings, 4% would record a second routine EEG, 
      48% a sleep-deprived EEG and 45% would not repeat the EEG. If a recurrent seizure 
      occurs within six, or after 12 or 24 months, 87%, 67% and 44% would respectively 
      conclude that the patient has epilepsy, while 57%, 65% and 72% would request an EEG. 
      When a patient experiences a recurrence while being treated with anti-epileptic 
      drugs, 11% of the respondents would request an EEG. Twenty-five percent would 
      request an EEG before stopping medication after two years of remission. CONCLUSION: 
      The variability in neurologists' reported strategies about the use of EEG in the 
      diagnosis of seizures is remarkably large. Consequences for the individual patient 
      may be significant, including treatment decisions and driving restrictions. The 
      availability and use of more sensitive diagnostic methods may be necessary to 
      enhance agreement between neurologists.

AB  - Long-term home monitoring of epileptic seizures is not feasible with the gold 
      standard of video/electro-encephalography (EEG) monitoring. The authors developed a 
      system and algorithm for nocturnal hypermotor seizure detection in pediatric 
      patients based on an accelerometer (ACM) attached to extremities. Seizure detection 
      is done using normal movement data, meaning that the system can be installed in a 
      new patient's room immediately as prior knowledge on the patient's seizures is not 
      needed for the patient-specific model. In this study, the authors compared 
      video/EEG-based seizure detection with ACM data in seven patients and found a 
      sensitivity of 95.71% and a positive predictive value of 57.84%. The authors focused 
      on hypermotor seizures given the availability of this seizure type in the data, the 
      typical occurrence of these seizures during sleep, i.e., when the measurements were 
      done, and the importance of detection of hypermotor seizures given their often 
      refractory nature and the possible serious consequences. To our knowledge, it is the 
      first detection system focusing on this type of seizure in pediatric patients.

AB  - Neurophysiological studies have reported functional network alterations in epilepsy, 
      most consistently in the theta frequency band. Highly interconnected brain regions 
      (so-called 'hubs') seem to be important in these epileptic networks. High frequency 
      oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial EEG recordings are recently discovered 
      biomarkers that can identify the epileptogenic area and are thought to result from 
      altered neuronal interactions. We studied whether the epileptogenic zone (identified 
      by HFOs and seizure onset zone) is associated with pathological hubs. Bilateral 
      depth electrode recordings from the hippocampus and amygdala were available from 
      twelve patients suspected of temporal lobe epilepsy. HFOs, classified as ripples 
      (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz), and epileptiform spikes were marked for 
      all patients in a five-minute epoch of slow-wave sleep. For each channel, we 
      computed hub-measures from a period without epileptiform spikes and found that the 
      epileptogenic zone was associated with a decreased hub-value in the theta frequency 
      band. The amount of HFOs, especially fast ripples, was negatively correlated with 
      the hub-value per channel. Results from post-hoc analyses of other frequency bands, 
      particularly the broad- and gamma frequency band, pointed in the same direction as 
      the results for the theta frequency band. These findings suggest a pathological 
      functional 'isolation' of the epileptogenic zone in the interictal state.

AB  - Epilepsy affects 0.5% of the population. A 25% of the patients referred to epilepsy 
      services have paroxysmal clinical events associated with motor activities, sensory 
      or emotional alterations, or consciousness impairment, which are not epileptic 
      seizures. The non-epileptic seizures can be classified as psychogenic, which do not 
      have a medical cause, and are associated with primary or secondary psychological 
      problems, and as of physiological origin. The non-epileptic events are manifested by 
      paroxysmal or repetitive behaviors that might be confused with epileptic seizures. 
      The diagnosis is very important in order to avoid unnecessary tests and iatrogenic 
      therapies. This study will present clinical cases and review of the main 
      non-epileptic physiological events (sleep disorders, movement disorders, 
      hypoxic-ischemic phenomena) and psychogenic events (somatoform disorders, fictitious 
      disorders and anxiety disorder).

AB  - Chromosomal copy number variants (CNV) are the most common genetic lesion found in 
      autism. Many autism-associated CNVs are duplications of chromosome 15q. Although 
      most cases of interstitial (int) dup(15) that present clinically are de novo and 
      maternally derived or inherited, both pathogenic and unaffected paternal 
      duplications of 15q have been identified. We performed a phenotype/genotype analysis 
      of individuals with interstitial 15q duplications to broaden our understanding of 
      the 15q syndrome and investigate the contribution of 15q duplication to increased 
      autism risk. All subjects were recruited solely on the basis of interstitial 
      duplication 15q11.2-q13 status. Comparative array genome hybridization was used to 
      determine the duplication size and boundaries while the methylation status of the 
      maternally methylated small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N gene was used to 
      determine the parent of origin of the duplication. We determined the duplication 
      size and parental origin for 14 int dup(15) subjects: 10 maternal and 4 paternal 
      cases. The majority of int dup(15) cases recruited were maternal in origin, most 
      likely due to our finding that maternal duplication was coincident with autism 
      spectrum disorder. The size of the duplication did not correlate with the severity 
      of the phenotype as established by Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale calibrated 
      severity score. We identified phenotypes not comprehensively described before in 
      this cohort including mild facial dysmorphism, sleep problems and an unusual 
      electroencephalogram variant. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that 
      the maternally expressed ubiquitin protein ligase E3A gene is primarily responsible 
      for the autism phenotype in int dup(15) since all maternal cases tested presented on 
      the autism spectrum.

AB  - Because signs of nocturnal seizures can overlap with sleep respiratory events, 
      clinicians can have difficulty distinguishing abnormal events related to sleep 
      disorders from epileptic seizures. We describe the case of a 3-year-old child 
      presenting with ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity associated with a 
      particular form of atypical obstructive sleep apnea, characterized by increased 
      respiratory rate, paradoxical breathing, desaturations, and tonic-dystonic posture 
      associated with movement artifacts. Following cardiorespiratory polysomnography, the 
      patient was initially misdiagnosed as having severe obstructive sleep apnea 
      syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relationship between seizures and interictal spikes remains 
      undetermined. We analyzed intracranial EEG (icEEG) recordings to examine the 
      relationship between the seizure onset area and interictal spikes. METHODS: 80 
      unselected patients were placed into 5 temporal, 4 extratemporal, and one 
      unlocalized groups based on the location of the seizure onset area. We studied 4-h 
      icEEG epochs, removed from seizures, from day-time and night-time during both on- 
      and off-medication periods. Spikes were detected automatically from electrode 
      contacts sampling the hemisphere ipsilateral to the seizure onset area. RESULTS: 
      There was a widespread occurrence of spikes over the hemisphere ipsilateral to the 
      seizure onset area. The spatial distributions of spike rates for the different 
      patient groups were different (p<0.0001, chi-square test). The area with the highest 
      spike rate coincided with the seizure onset area only in half of the patients. 
      CONCLUSION: The spatial distribution of spike rates is strongly associated with the 
      location of the seizure onset area, suggesting the presence of a distributed spike 
      generation network, which is related to the seizure onset area. SIGNIFICANCE: The 
      spatial distribution of spike rates, but not the area with the highest spike rate, 
      may hold value for the localization of the seizure onset area.

TI  - Disturbances in slow-wave sleep are induced by models of bilateral inflammation,

AB  - Preclinical assessment of pain has typically relied on measuring animal responses to 
      evoked stimulation. Because of inherent limitations of these assays, there is a need 
      to develop measures of animal pain/discomfort that are objective, not experimentally 
      evoked, and mimic the human condition. Patients with chronic pain manifest a variety 
      of co-morbidities, one of which is disturbances in sleep. We used 
      electroencephalography to objectively assess 4 rat models of pain 
      (inflammatory/complete Freund's adjuvant [CFA], neuropathic/chronic constriction 
      injury [CCI], postoperative/skin incision, osteoarthritis/monosodium iodoacetate 
      [MIA]) for the occurrence of sleep disturbances. Four different measures of 
      slow-wave sleep (SWS) were examined: amplitude of 1- to 4-Hz waves, total time spent 
      in SWS, time spent in SWS-1, and time spent in SWS-2. Bilateral injuries were more 
      likely to induce a sleep disturbance than unilateral injuries in the CFA, CCI, and 
      skin incision assays. Sleep disturbances occurred in the deeper stage of SWS, as the 
      amplitude of 1- to 4-Hz waves and time spent in SWS-2 were significantly decreased 
      in all models except the osteoarthritis model. Sleep disturbances lasted for 
      approximately 3 to 14days, depending on the model, and were resolved despite 
      continued hypersensitivity to evoked stimulation. Morphine, gabapentin, diclofenac, 
      and ABT-102 (TRPV1 antagonist) all improved sleep in the bilateral CFA assay at 
      doses that did not significantly alter SWS in uninjured rats. Preclinical assessment 
      of compounds should follow the path of clinical studies and take into account 
      diverse aspects of the "pain condition." This would include evaluating nociceptive 
      thresholds as well as other endpoints, such as cognition and sleep, that may be 
      affected by the pathological state.

AB  - Thyroid hormones induce short-latency nongenomic effects in adult brain tissue, 
      suggesting that their acute administration would affect brain activity in intact 
      animals. The influence on EEG-defined sleep of acute restoration of 
      l-3,3'5-triiodothyronine (T3) to a sleep-regulatory brain region, the preoptic 
      region, was examined in hypothyroid rats. Sleep parameters were monitored for 48 h 
      weekly: for 24 h immediately following a control microinjection and for an 
      additional 24h after a second microinjection including a T3 dose to the preoptic 
      region or lateral ventricle. Male albino rats were implanted with EEG and EMG 
      electrodes, abdominal temperature/activity transponders and unilateral lateral 
      ventricle cannulae or bilateral preoptic region cannulae, and were given 0.02% 
      n-propythiouracil (PTU) in their drinking water for 4 weeks. For 
      histologically-confirmed bilateral preoptic region cannula placements (N=7), effects 
      of T3 (especially a 3 μg dose) were apparent within 10h of injection as decreases in 
      REM, NREM and total sleep and increases in waking and activity. Minimal effects of 
      lateral ventricle T3 microinjection were demonstrated (N=5). Significant effects due 
      to the time of day on the experimental measures were seen in both lateral ventricle 
      and preoptic region groups, but these effects did not interact with the effect of 
      administered hormone dose. These effects of T3 microinjection to the preoptic region 
      were demonstrated after acute injections and within hours of injection rather than 
      after chronic administration over days.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the impact of continuous positive airway 
      pressure (CPAP) therapy on short-term memory (STM) over sustained wakefulness in 
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). We have 
      investigated if impaired STM can be reversed by CPAP treatment in a 24-h sustained 
      wakefulness paradigm. METHODS: Our follow-up study was conducted with 
      repeated-memory tasks within 12 OSAHS patients and 10 healthy controls who underwent 
      three 32-h sessions, one before CPAP (T0) and the second (T3) and the third (T6), 
      after 3 and 6 months of treatment, respectively, for OSAHS patients. Each session 
      included one night of sleep followed by 24h of sustained wakefulness, during which 
      both groups performed STM tasks including both digit span (DS) and Sternberg tasks. 
      RESULTS: Untreated OSAHS patients had no deficit in the forward DS task measuring 
      immediate memory but were impaired in STM, especially working memory assessed by the 
      complex Sternberg task and the backward DS. However, only performance in the latter 
      was improved after 6 months of CPAP treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Because the high level 
      of memory scanning required high speed in information processing, persistent 
      impairment on the complex Sternberg task may be attributable to working memory 
      slowing, possibly enhanced by sustained wakefulness.

AB  - Continuous positive airway pressure treatment (CPAP) is administered to treat the 
      common disorder of obstructive sleep apnea. However, patients receiving CPAP 
      treatment without a sleep assessment and clinical diagnosis often do not feel or 
      understand the improvement in their condition, necessitating a sleep quality 
      improvement index for physicians to analyze improvements in patient treatment 
      rapidly. This work presents a novel sleep quality evaluation system that calculates 
      the improvement value for sleep quality using electroencephalogram and 
      electrocardiogram signal features, as well as fuzzy inferences. Experimental results 
      indicate that the sleep quality improvement rating of the proposed system and that 
      of the apnea-hyponea index correlate with each other. Importantly, the proposed 
      system can identify considerable levels of improvement in the physiological signals 
      of patients having undergone CPAP treatment.

TI  - In pre-school children, sleep objectively assessed via sleep-EEGs remains stable 
      over 12 months and is related to psychological functioning, but not to cortisol 
      secretion.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Cross-sectional studies provide evidence that in pre-schoolers 
      poor sleep is by this age already associated with both poor psychological 
      functioning and an increased cortisol secretion. However, long-term studies on the 
      stability of sleep in pre-schoolers are scarce. The aim of the present study was 
      therefore to investigate objectively assessed sleep in pre-schoolers longitudinally, 
      and to predict sleep, psychological functioning and cortisol secretion prospectively 
      as a function of sleep 12 months earlier. METHOD: A total of 58 pre-schoolers (mean 
      age: 5.43 years; 47% females) were re-assessed 12 months later (mean age: 6.4 
      years). Sleep-EEG recordings were performed, saliva cortisol was analysed, and 
      parents and experts rated children's psychological functioning. RESULTS: 
      Longitudinally, poor objective sleep at age 5.4 years was associated with poor 
      objective sleep and psychological difficulties but not cortisol secretion 12 months 
      later. At age 6.4 years, poor sleep was concurrently associated with greater 
      psychological difficulties and increased cortisol secretion. CONCLUSION: In 
      pre-schoolers, poor sleep objectively assessed at the age of 5.4 years was 
      associated with poor sleep and psychological difficulties one year later. Data 
      indicate that in pre-schoolers, sleep remains stable over a 12-months-period. 
      Pre-schoolers with poor sleep appear to be at risk for developing further 
      psychological difficulties.

AB  - A 4-year-old girl who had been born of normal pregnancy and delivery and had an 
      unremarkable family or personal history was referred to a neuropsychiatric 
      department because of the appearance of peculiar nocturnal episodes. Parents 
      described that their child abruptly became stiff during sleep. These episodes 
      usually ranged from 20 to 40 seconds, and after that the child continued to sleep. 
      Initially she presented 1 episode per week, but there was a progressive increase in 
      frequency up to 3 to 4 times per night. The child never presented similar episodes 
      while awake. Her examination revealed some café-au-lait spots, congenital 
      microcephaly (3rd centile) and low stature for the age (10th centile). She did not 
      present any neurologic deficit, but she failed to develop an age-appropriate speech, 
      with a delay in the main language milestones.

TI  - Proportion of surgical patients with undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnoea.
PG  - 629-36
LID - 10.1093/bja/aes465 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) affects ~9-24% of the general population, 
      and 90% remain undiagnosed. Those patients with undiagnosed moderate-to-severe OSA 
      may be associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications. Our 
      objective was to evaluate the proportion of surgical patients with undiagnosed 
      moderate-to-severe OSA. METHODS: After research ethics board approval, patients 
      visiting preoperative clinics were recruited over 4 yr and screened with the 
      STOP-BANG questionnaire. The 1085 patients, who consented, subsequently underwent 
      polysomnography (PSG) (laboratory or portable) before operation. Chart review was 
      conducted in this historical cohort to ascertain the clinical diagnosis of OSA by 
      surgeons and anaesthetists, blinded to the PSG results. The PSG study-identified OSA 
      patients were further classified based on severity using the apnoea-hypopnoea index 
      (AHI) cut-offs. RESULTS: Of 819 patients, 111 patients had pre-existing OSA and 58% 
      (64/111) were not diagnosed by the surgeons and 15% (17/111) were not diagnosed by 
      the anaesthetists. Among the 708 study patients, PSG showed that 233 (31%) had no 
      OSA, 218 (31%) patients had mild OSA (AHI: 5-15); 148 (21%) had moderate OSA (AHI: 
      15-30), and 119 (17%) had severe OSA (AHI>30). Before operation, of the 267 patients 
      with moderate-to-severe OSA, 92% (n=245) and 60% (n=159) were not diagnosed by the 
      surgeons and the anaesthetists, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found that 
      anaesthetists and surgeons failed to identify a significant number of patients with 
      pre-existing OSA and symptomatic undiagnosed OSA, before operation. This study may 
      provide an impetus for more diligent case finding of OSA before operation.

AB  - Obesity resistance due to elevated orexin signaling is accompanied by high levels of 
      spontaneous physical activity (SPA). The behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying 
      this observation have not been fully worked out. We determined the contribution of 
      hypothalamic orexin receptors (OXRs) to SPA stimulated by orexin A (OXA), whether 
      OXA-stimulated SPA was secondary to arousal and whether voluntary wheel running led 
      to compensations in 24-h SPA. We further tested whether orexin action on dopamine 
      one receptors (DA1R) in the substantia nigra (SN) plays an important role in the 
      generation of SPA. To test this, SPA response was determined in lean and obese rats 
      with cannulae targeted toward the rostral lateral hypothalamus (rLH) or SN. 
      Sleep/wake states were also measured in rats with rLH cannula and 
      electroencephalogram/electromyogram radiotelemetry transmitters. SPA in lean rats 
      was more sensitive to antagonism of the OX1R and in the early response to the orexin 
      2 agonist. OXA increased arousal equally in lean and obese rodents, which is 
      discordant from the greater SPA response in lean rats. Obesity-resistant rats ran 
      more and wheel running was directly related to 24-h SPA levels. The OX1R antagonist, 
      SB-334867-A, and the DA1R antagonist, SCH3390, in SN more effectively reduced SPA 
      stimulated by OXA in obesity-resistant rats. These data suggest OXA-stimulated SPA 
      is not secondary to enhanced arousal, propensity for SPA parallels inclination to 
      run and that orexin action on dopaminergic neurons in SN may participate in the 
      mediation of SPA and running wheel activity.

AB  - Peripheral injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) facilitates 8-10Hz 
      spike-wave discharges (SWD) characterizing absence epilepsy in WAG/Rij rats. It is 
      unknown however, whether peripherally administered LPS is able to alter the 
      generator areas of epileptic activity at the molecular level. We injected 1mg/kg 
      dose of LPS intraperitoneally into WAG/Rij rats, recorded the body temperature and 
      EEG, and examined the protein expression changes of the proteome 12h after injection 
      in the fronto-parietal cortex and thalamus. We used fluorescent two-dimensional 
      differential gel electrophoresis to investigate the expression profile. We found 16 
      differentially expressed proteins in the fronto-parietal cortex and 35 proteins in 
      the thalamus. It is known that SWD genesis correlates with the transitional state of 
      sleep-wake cycle thus we performed meta-analysis of the altered proteins in relation 
      to inflammation, epilepsy as well as sleep. The analysis revealed that all 
      categories are highly represented by the altered proteins and these protein-sets 
      have considerable overlap. Protein network modeling suggested that the alterations 
      in the proteome were largely induced by the immune response, which invokes the NFkB 
      signaling pathway. The proteomics and computational analysis verified the known 
      functional interplay between inflammation, epilepsy and sleep and highlighted 
      proteins that are involved in their common synaptic mechanisms. Our physiological 
      findings support the phenomenon that high dose of peripheral LPS injection increases 
      SWD-number, modifies its duration as well as the sleep-wake stages and decreases 
      body temperature.

AB  - Adult-onset epilepsy is commonly thought to be secondary to a brain lesion. However, 
      the etiology of adult-onset epilepsy remains unknown in approximately 25% of 
      patients, despite progress in medical and diagnostic tools. In the present study, we 
      investigated whether late-onset partial cryptogenic epilepsies could be subgrouped 
      based on seizure semiology and clinical characteristics. A total of 41 patients with 
      late-onset cryptogenic epilepsy were included, and the corresponding clinical and 
      electrophysiological data were analyzed. The following three clinical subgroups were 
      identified: 1) a group that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of transient epileptic 
      amnesia (TEA); 2) a group with late-onset cryptogenic epilepsies with a temporal 
      seizure semiology; and 3) a cryptogenic extratemporal group, which was consistent 
      with the categorization of cryptogenic epilepsies, i.e., epilepsies involving 
      unknown lesions. The temporal group showed homogeneous clinical characteristics, 
      especially a rapid evolution and a greater tendency toward generalization and 
      pharmacoresistance compared with the other two groups. Transient epileptic amnesia 
      was associated with a higher frequency of sleep disorders than either of the other 
      groups. Our findings argue for the clinical identification of a subgroup of 
      late-onset temporal epilepsy that might constitute an idiopathic form. The 
      association between TEA and sleep disorders would suggest a possible 
      pathophysiological role of sleep apnea syndromes in TEA.

PG  - 769-72
LID - 10.1111/dmcn.12197 [doi]
AB  - STXBP1 encephalopathy is associated with a range of movement disorders. We observed 
      head stereotypies in three patients. These comprised a slow (<1Hz), high-amplitude, 
      horizontal, 'figure-of-eight' pattern, beginning at age 4-6 years and resulting in 
      neck muscle hypertrophy, in two males; a faster (2-3Hz), side-to-side, 'no' 
      movement, starting at the age of 9 years 6 months was observed in one female. Upper 
      limb and truncal stereotypies and vocalization occurred intermittently with the head 
      movements. The stereotypies increased with excitement but settled with concentration 
      and sleep. Head and upper limb stereotypies are valuable clinical clues to the 
      diagnosis of STXBP1 encephalopathy in patients with profound impairments.

TI  - Combining hidden Markov models for comparing the dynamics of multiple sleep 
      electroencephalograms.
PG  - 3342-56
LID - 10.1002/sim.5747 [doi]
AB  - In this manuscript, we consider methods for the analysis of populations of 
      electroencephalogram signals during sleep for the study of sleep disorders using 
      hidden Markov models (HMMs). Notably, we propose an easily implemented method for 
      simultaneously modeling multiple time series that involve large amounts of data. We 
      apply these methods to study sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in the Sleep Heart 
      Health Study (SHHS), a landmark study of SDB and cardiovascular consequences. We use 
      the entire, longitudinally collected, SHHS cohort to develop HMM population 
      parameters, which we then apply to obtain subject-specific Markovian predictions. 
      From these predictions, we create several indices of interest, such as transition 
      frequencies between latent states. Our HMM analysis of electroencephalogram signals 
      uncovers interesting findings regarding differences in brain activity during sleep 
      between those with and without SDB. These findings include stability of the percent 
      time spent in HMM latent states across matched diseased and non-diseased groups and 
      differences in the rate of transitioning.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify the relationship between lambda waves 
      (LWs) and other occipital waveforms, in a retrospective analysis of 
      electroencephalograms (EEGs) of clinic and hospitalized patients at a single center. 
      The LWs were correlated with α rhythm, photic driving, and positive occipital sharp 
      transients of sleep (POSTS). A computer-generated cursor quantified amplitude and 
      duration of POSTS and LWs (3 waveforms and both hemispheres). Fisher exact test was 
      used for significance (P ≤ .05). A total of 116 patients were evaluated. Of 111 
      patients, with interpretable results, 74 (66.67%) had visual scanning during EEG, 
      with 37 (50.0%) having LWs. The LWs (17.69 µV) were consistently smaller than POSTS 
      (31.40 µV) despite similar morphology. Patients with an α rhythm of >8.5 Hz were 
      strongly correlated with the presence of LWs (P < .0001), and those with LWs were 
      strongly predictive of normal EEG (P = .001). Of the 37 patients, 27 (73.0%) with 
      LWs had photic driving (P = .0496). No correlation was found between LWs and POSTS 
      (P = .45). The presence of LWs and a low normal posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) 
      suggests intact electrocerebral health. LWs and the photic driving response suggest 
      similar generators but stimulus-specific networks. POSTS differ from LWs despite 
      similar morphology, suggesting different network activation of occipital generators. 
      LWs have clinical significance in excluding encephalopathy. Occipital generators are 
      differentiated by state and stimulus-dependent network activation and not by 
      location and morphology.

TI  - Electrophysiological evidence of atypical processing underlying mental set shifting 
      in ecstasy polydrug and polydrug users.
PG  - 507-15
LID - 10.1037/a0034002 [doi]
AB  - Executive functioning deficits are reported in ecstasy users. However research into 
      mental set switching has been equivocal, with behavioral studies suggesting the 
      function is preserved. The current study sought to address the issue of switching 
      deficits in ecstasy users by combining behavioral performance with 
      electrophysiological correlates (electroencephalography; EEG). Twenty ecstasy 
      polydrug users, 20 nonecstasy polydrug users, and 20 drug naive controls were 
      recruited. Participants completed questionnaires about their drug use, sleep 
      quality, fluid intelligence, and current mood state. Each participant completed a 
      mental set switching task (the number-letter task) while EEG measures were recorded. 
      Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no between-group differences on performance of 
      the task; however a regression suggested that ecstasy use was a significant 
      predictor for performance, after controlling for cannabis use. Mixed ANOVA revealed 
      a significant effect of group on the P3, with significant differences between both 
      drug groups and naives. There was also an interaction between electrode and group on 
      the P2 component, with ecstasy users differing from both other groups. On the P3 
      component the results suggest a reduction in positivity at parieto-occipital 
      electrodes for drug users compared to controls. Furthermore a significant increase 
      in negativity in ecstasy users compared to control groups could be observed in 
      several occipito-parietal electrodes at an N2 component as well as observable 
      atypicalities in early processing (P2) displayed by ecstasy users and polydrug 
      controls. The present study provides evidence of atypical processing of attentional 
      shifting in ecstasy and polydrug users. Deficits in this executive function could 
      reflect cognitive inflexibility and paucity of rapid behavioral adjustment, which 
      may be problematic in real world situations.

TI  - Amygdala lesions reduce cataplexy in orexin knock-out mice.
PG  - 9734-42
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5632-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive sleepiness and cataplexy, sudden episodes 
      of muscle weakness during waking that are thought to be an intrusion of rapid eye 
      movement sleep muscle atonia into wakefulness. One of the most striking aspects of 
      cataplexy is that it is often triggered by strong, generally positive emotions, but 
      little is known about the neural pathways through which positive emotions trigger 
      muscle atonia. We hypothesized that the amygdala is functionally important for 
      cataplexy because the amygdala has a role in processing emotional stimuli and it 
      contains neurons that are active during cataplexy. Using anterograde and retrograde 
      tracing in mice, we found that GABAergic neurons in the central nucleus of the 
      amygdala heavily innervate neurons that maintain waking muscle tone such as those in 
      the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, lateral pontine tegmentum, locus ceruleus, 
      and dorsal raphe. We then found that bilateral, excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala 
      markedly reduced cataplexy in orexin knock-out mice, a model of narcolepsy. These 
      lesions did not alter basic sleep-wake behavior but substantially reduced the 
      triggering of cataplexy. Lesions also reduced the cataplexy events triggered by 
      conditions associated with high arousal and positive emotions (i.e., wheel running 
      and chocolate). These observations demonstrate that the amygdala is a functionally 
      important part of the circuitry underlying cataplexy and suggest that increased 
      amygdala activity in response to emotional stimuli could directly trigger cataplexy 
      by inhibiting brainstem regions that suppress muscle atonia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sleep inertia refers to the inability to attain full alertness 
      following awakening from sleep and is a major component of hypersomnia. As 
      event-related potentials (ERPs) are correlated to the degree of consciousness, they 
      allow exploring information processing in transitional states of vigilance. Their 
      modifications during forced awakening (FA) context have been shown to reflect sleep 
      inertia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic value of a FA test using an oddball 
      stimulation protocol during a nap in a representative sample of patients with 
      excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). METHODS: One hundred and seventy three patients 
      [30 narcolepsy, 62 idiopathic hypersomnia, 33 sleep apnoea syndrome, and 48 other 
      (mainly psychiatric) hypersomnia] performed an auditory target detection stimulation 
      task during pre-, post-nap wakefulness, and during two successive intra-nap FA while 
      the EEG was simultaneously recorded. Both the accuracy of target detection and the 
      ERPs were evaluated. ERPs during forced awakening test were considered to reflect 
      sleep inertia if they presented with a P300 delay and/or sleep negativities 
      (N350/N550). RESULTS: Pre-nap behavior and ERPs were normal in all patients. 
      Behavioral results were significantly worse during FA than during wakefulness for 
      all groups of patients. P300 latencies were significantly delayed on FA conditions 
      in each group of patients except the psychiatric group. Sensitivity and specificity 
      for detection of sleep inertia were 64% and 94%, respectively, with predictive 
      values of 96% (positive) and 50% (negative). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 
      the FA test could be helpful as a diagnostic procedure for discriminating 
      neurological from psychiatric hypersomnia.

AB  - This review will examine objective physiological abnormalities and medical 
      comorbidities associated with insomnia and assess the need to measure parameters 
      associated with these abnormalities for diagnosis and to monitor treatment outcomes. 
      Findings are used to develop a decision tree for the work-up of insomnia patients. 
      Currently available measures and those with possible future predictive value will be 
      discussed. Costs, advantages, and the development of screening laboratory tests will 
      be presented. It is concluded that there is a need to differentially evaluate 
      insomnia patients based upon their comorbidities and the presence of objectively 
      decreased total sleep time to direct optimal treatment. The development of objective 
      diagnostic criteria and treatment outcome goals beyond subjective symptomatic relief 
      will establish insomnia as a true medical problem and improve patient care.

AB  - The Department of Health is promoting the generation of specialist networks to 
      manage long term ventilatory weaning and domiciliary non-invasive ventilation 
      patients. Currently the availability of these services in England is not known. We 
      performed a short survey to establish the prevalence of sleep and ventilation 
      diagnostic and treatment services. The survey focussed on diagnostic services and 
      Home Mechanical Ventilation (HMV) provision, and was divided into (a) availability 
      of diagnostics, (b) funding, and (c) patient groups. This survey has confirmed that 
      the majority of Home Mechanical Ventilation set-ups are currently for Obesity 
      Related Respiratory Failure and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. We have found 
      that there is variable provision of diagnostic services, with the majority of units 
      offering overnight oximetry (95%) but only 55% of responders providing a home 
      mechanical ventilation service. Even more interestingly, less than two thirds of 
      units charged their primary care trust for this service. These data may assist in 
      the development of regional networks and specialist home mechanical ventilation 
      centres.

TI  - Direct effects of light on alertness, vigilance, and the waking electroencephalogram 
      in humans depend on prior light history.
PG  - 1239-46
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2894 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Light can induce an acute alerting response in humans; however, it 
      is unknown whether the magnitude of this response is simply a function of the 
      absolute illuminance of the light itself, or whether it depends on illuminance 
      history preceding the stimulus. Here, we compared the effects of illuminance history 
      on the alerting response to a subsequent light stimulus. DESIGN: A randomized, 
      crossover design was used to compare the effect of two illuminance histories (1 lux 
      vs. 90 lux) on the alerting response to a 6.5-h 90-lux light stimulus during the 
      biological night. SETTING: Intensive Physiologic Monitoring Unit, Brigham and 
      Women's Hospital, Boston, MA. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen healthy young adults (6 F; 23.5 
      ± 2.9 years). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were administered two 6.5-h light 
      exposures (LE) of 90 lux during the biological night. For 3 days prior to each LE, 
      participants were exposed to either 1 lux or 90 lux during the wake episode. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The alerting response to light was assessed using 
      subjective sleepiness ratings, lapses of attention, and reaction times as measured 
      with an auditory psychomotor vigilance task, as well as power density in the 
      delta/theta range of the waking EEG. The alerting response to light was greater and 
      lasted longer when the LE followed exposure to 1 lux compared to 90 lux light. 
      CONCLUSION: The magnitude and duration of the alerting effect of light at night 
      depends on the illuminance history and appears to be subject to sensitization and 
      adaptation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Substantial brain development occurs during adolescence providing the 
      foundation for functional advancement from stimulus-bound "bottom-up" to more mature 
      executive-driven "top-down" processing strategies. The objective was to assess 
      development of EEG markers of these strategies and their role in both preparatory 
      attention (contingent negative variation, CNV) and response monitoring (Error 
      Related Negativity, ERN, and Correct Related Negativity, CRN). METHODS: CNV, ERN and 
      CRN were assessed in 38 adolescents (18 girls), age 11-18 years, using a variation 
      of a letter discrimination task. RESULTS: Accuracy increased with age and 
      developmental stage. Younger adolescents used a posterior attention network involved 
      in inhibiting irrelevant information. Activity in this juvenile network, as indexed 
      by a posteriorly-biased CNV and CRN decreased with age and advancing pubertal 
      development. Although enhanced frontal CNV, known to be predictive of accuracy in 
      adults, was not detected even in the older adolescents, top-down medial frontal 
      response monitoring processes (ERN) showed evidence of development within the 
      age-range studied. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed a dissociation of developmental 
      progress, marked by relatively delayed onset of frontal preparatory attention 
      relative to error monitoring. SIGNIFICANCE: This dissociation may render adolescents 
      vulnerable to excessive risk-taking and disinhibited behavior imposed by 
      asynchronous development of component cognitive control processes.

TI  - Thalamic olfaction: characterizing odor processing in the mediodorsal thalamus of 
      the rat.
PG  - 1274-85
LID - 10.1152/jn.00741.2013 [doi]
AB  - Thalamus is a key crossroad structure involved in various functions relative to 
      visual, auditory, gustatory, and somatosensory senses. Because of the specific 
      organization of the olfactory pathway (i.e., no direct thalamic relay between 
      sensory neurons and primary cortex), relatively little attention has been directed 
      toward the thalamus in olfaction. However, an olfactory thalamus exists: the 
      mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MDT) receives input from various olfactory 
      structures including the piriform cortex. How the MDT contributes to olfactory 
      perception remains unanswered. The present study is a first step to gain insight 
      into the function of the MDT in olfactory processing. Spontaneous and odor-evoked 
      activities were recorded in both the MDT (single unit and local field potential) and 
      the piriform cortex (local field potential) of urethane-anesthetized rats. We 
      demonstrate that: 1) odorant presentation induces a conjoint, coherent emergence of 
      beta-frequency-band oscillations in both the MDT and the piriform cortex; 2) 51% of 
      MDT single units were odor-responsive with narrow-tuning characteristics across an 
      odorant set, which included biological, monomolecular, and mixture stimuli. In fact, 
      a majority of MDT units responded to only one odor within the set; 3) the MDT and 
      the piriform cortex showed tightly related activities with, for example, nearly 20% 
      of MDT firing in phase with piriform cortical beta-frequency oscillations; and 4) 
      MDT-piriform cortex coherence was state-dependent with enhanced coupling during 
      slow-wave activity. These data are discussed in the context of the hypothesized role 
      of MDT in olfactory perception and attention.

TI  - What are you looking at? Moving toward an attentional timeline in insomnia: a novel 
      semantic eye tracking study.
PG  - 1491-9
LID - 10.5665/sleep.3042 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To date, cognitive probe paradigms have been used in different 
      guises to obtain reaction time measurements suggestive of an attention bias towards 
      sleep in insomnia. This study adopts a methodology which is novel to sleep research 
      to obtain a continual record of where the eyes-and therefore attention-are being 
      allocated with regard to sleep and neutral stimuli. DESIGN: A head mounted eye 
      tracker (Eyelink II,SR Research, Ontario, Canada) was used to monitor eye movements 
      in respect to two words presented on a computer screen, with one word being a sleep 
      positive, sleep negative, or neutral word above or below a second distracter 
      pseudoword. Probability and reaction times were the outcome measures. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Sleep group classification was determined by screening interview and PSQI (> 8 = 
      insomnia, < 3 = good sleeper) score. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Those individuals 
      with insomnia took longer to fixate on the target word and remained fixated for less 
      time than the good sleep controls. Word saliency had an effect with longer first 
      fixations on positive and negative sleep words in both sleep groups, with largest 
      effect sizes seen with the insomnia group. CONCLUSIONS: This overall delay in those 
      with insomnia with regard to vigilance and maintaining attention on the target words 
      moves away from previous attention bias work showing a bias towards sleep, 
      particularly negative, stimuli but is suggestive of a neurocognitive deficit in line 
      with recent research.

TI  - Circuit level defects in the developing neocortex of Fragile X mice.
PG  - 903-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.3415 [doi]
AB  - Subtle alterations in how cortical network dynamics are modulated by different 
      behavioral states could disrupt normal brain function and underlie symptoms of 
      neuropsychiatric disorders, including Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Using two-photon 
      calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we recorded spontaneous neuronal ensemble 
      activity in mouse somatosensory cortex. Unanesthetized Fmr1(-/-) mice exhibited 
      abnormally high synchrony of neocortical network activity, especially during the 
      first two postnatal weeks. Neuronal firing rates were threefold higher in Fmr1(-/-) 
      mice than in wild-type mice during whole-cell recordings manifesting Up/Down states 
      (slow-wave sleep, quiet wakefulness), probably as a result of a higher firing 
      probability during Up states. Combined electroencephalography and calcium imaging 
      experiments confirmed that neurons in mutant mice had abnormally high firing and 
      synchrony during sleep. We conclude that cortical networks in FXS are hyperexcitable 
      in a brain state-dependent manner during a critical period for experience-dependent 
      plasticity. These state-dependent network defects could explain the intellectual, 
      sleep and sensory integration dysfunctions associated with FXS.

AB  - According to the neurocognitive perspective on insomnia, conditioned arousal results 
      in impairment of information processing, as such interfering with normal sleep 
      processes. In the present study, evening event-related potentials N100 and P200 were 
      evaluated to assess hyperarousal in patients with insomnia and controls. 13 patients 
      (mean age = 40.8) with polysomnographically verified sleep disruptions and 11 good 
      sleepers (mean age = 45.4) were included. An auditory oddball paradigm was 
      administered the evening of the polysomnography. N100 and P200 mean amplitudes and 
      peak latencies at Fz and Cz were analyzed as a measure of respectively general 
      arousability and inhibition of information processing. Patients experiencing 
      insomnia were characterized by decreased P200 amplitudes compared to good sleepers. 
      No significant differences were found for N100 amplitudes and latencies of both ERP 
      waves. These results suggest that this group of patients with objectified insomnia 
      is characterized by an arousal impairment. However, there was no evidence of 
      hyperarousal, considering the normal N100 amplitudes. On the other hand, the 
      inhibition of information processing was distorted. As such, the impairment of 
      de-arousal or de-activation in insomnia is put forward as an additional factor 
      within the arousal model.

AB  - Four patients with refractory epilepsy and hypermotor seizures (HMS) benefited from 
      an intracerebral investigation after a presurgical evaluation and demonstrated an 
      ictal onset zone primarily involving the posterior cortex, specifically the 
      posterior cingulate gyrus in two patients. At seizure onset, these two patients 
      reported a falling sensation, followed by HMSs characterized by swinging movements 
      of the trunk with intense grasping of the bed railing. The two other patients with 
      lateral parietal seizure onset reported blurred vision and dizziness, followed by a 
      mixed pattern of the previously described type 1 and 2 HMSs. Three patients have 
      been operated on, including two class I of Engel after 36 and 52months of follow-up. 
      One patient developed a postoperative infection and continues to suffer seizures. 
      Pathological findings disclosed a type IIa focal cortical dysplasia in all the 
      patients. The last patient is awaiting surgery. Posterior cortex epilepsies, 
      including those originating from the posterior cingulate cortex, can be responsible 
      for HMSs.

TI  - Effects of orexin gene transfer in the dorsolateral pons in orexin knockout mice.
PG  - 31-40
LID - 10.5665/sleep.2296 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by loss of orexin 
      neurons. Previously, our group demonstrated that transfer of the orexin gene into 
      surrogate neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and the zona incerta significantly 
      reduced cataplexy bouts in the orexin-ataxin-3 mice model of narcolepsy. The current 
      study determined the effects of orexin gene transfer into the dorsolateral pontine 
      neurons in the orexin knockout (KO) mice model of narcolepsy. The dorsolateral pons 
      was chosen because it plays a critical role in regulating muscle tone and thus it is 
      conceivable to be involved in cataplexy as well. Cataplexy is the pathognomonic 
      symptom in narcolepsy. DESIGN: Independent groups of orexin KO mice were given 
      bilateral microinjections (0.75 μL each side) of either recombinant adenoassociated 
      virus-orexin (rAAV-orexin; n = 7), or rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP; n = 
      7) into the dorsolateral pons. A group of orexin KO mice that did not receive rAAV 
      (n = 7) and a group of wild-type mice (C57BL/J6; n = 5) were used as controls. Three 
      weeks after rAAV-mediated gene transfer narcolepsy symptoms were examined using 
      sleep and behavioral recordings. Number, location of the orexin-immunoreactive 
      neurons, and relative density of orexin immunoreactive fibers were determined. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Orexin gene transfer into the dorsolateral pons 
      significantly decreased cataplexy and modestly improved wake maintenance compared to 
      the orexin KO mice that did not receive rAAV. In contrast, GFP gene transfer 
      worsened narcoleptic symptoms compared to the no-rAAV orexin KO group. CONCLUSION: 
      Orexin gene transfer into the dorsolateral pontine neurons can control cataplexy 
      attacks and modestly improve wake maintenance.

TI  - Motor cortex plasticity induced by theta burst stimulation is impaired in patients 
      with obstructive sleep apnoea.
PG  - 1844-52
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12203 [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a respiratory condition occurring during sleep 
      characterised by repeated collapse of the upper airway. Patients with OSA show 
      altered brain structure and function that may manifest as impaired neuroplasticity. 
      We assessed this hypothesis in 13 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA and 11 
      healthy control subjects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to induce and 
      measure neuroplastic changes in the motor cortex by assessing changes in 
      motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in a hand muscle. Baseline measurements of cortical 
      excitability included active (AMT) and resting motor thresholds (RMT), and the 
      maximal stimulator output producing a 1-mV MEP. Intracortical inhibition (ICI) was 
      investigated with short- and long-interval ICI paradigms (SICI and LICI, 
      respectively), and neuroplastic changes were induced using continuous theta burst 
      stimulation (cTBS). At baseline, differences were found between groups for RMT (9.5% 
      maximal stimulator output higher in OSA) and 1-mV MEPs (10.3% maximal stimulator 
      output higher in OSA), but not AMT. No differences were found between groups for 
      SICI or LICI. The response to cTBS was different between groups, with control 
      subjects showing an expected reduction in MEP amplitude after cTBS, whereas the MEPs 
      in patients with OSA did not change. The lack of response to cTBS suggests impaired 
      long-term depression-like neuroplasticity in patients with OSA, which may be a 
      consequence of sleep fragmentation or chronic blood gas disturbance in sleep. This 
      reduced neuroplastic capacity may have implications for the learning, retention or 
      consolidation of motor skills in patients with OSA.

AB  - Consciousness is an emergent property of the complex brain network. In order to 
      understand how consciousness is constructed, neural interactions within this network 
      must be elucidated. Previous studies have shown that specific neural interactions 
      between the thalamus and frontoparietal cortices; frontal and parietal cortices; and 
      parietal and temporal cortices are correlated with levels of consciousness. However, 
      due to technical limitations, the network underlying consciousness has not been 
      investigated in terms of large-scale interactions with high temporal and spectral 
      resolution. In this study, we recorded neural activity with dense electrocorticogram 
      (ECoG) arrays and used the spectral Granger causality to generate a more 
      comprehensive network that relates to consciousness in monkeys. We found that neural 
      interactions were significantly different between conscious and unconscious states 
      in all combinations of cortical region pairs. Furthermore, the difference in neural 
      interactions between conscious and unconscious states could be represented in 4 
      frequency-specific large-scale networks with unique interaction patterns: 2 networks 
      were related to consciousness and showed peaks in alpha and beta bands, while the 
      other 2 networks were related to unconsciousness and showed peaks in theta and gamma 
      bands. Moreover, networks in the unconscious state were shared amongst 3 different 
      unconscious conditions, which were induced either by ketamine and medetomidine, 
      propofol, or sleep. Our results provide a novel picture that the difference between 
      conscious and unconscious states is characterized by a switch in frequency-specific 
      modes of large-scale communications across the entire cortex, rather than the 
      cessation of interactions between specific cortical regions.

TI  - Relationship between objectively recorded hot flashes and sleep disturbances among 
      breast cancer patients: investigating hot flash characteristics other than 
      frequency.
PG  - 997-1005
LID - 10.1097/GME.0b013e3182885e31 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between various 
      characteristics of objectively recorded hot flashes and sleep disturbances in breast 
      cancer patients. METHODS: Fifty-six women who had completed a similar treatment 
      protocol for a first diagnosis of breast cancer within the previous 3 months wore 
      ambulatory sternal skin conductance and polysomnography devices for a home-based 
      nighttime recording of hot flashes and sleep. RESULTS: Hot flash frequency was not 
      associated with polysomnographic variables (r = -0.18 to 0.21) or beta-I and beta-II 
      electroencephalographic activities (r = -0.01 and 0.03) but was significantly 
      correlated with increased slow (r = 0.28) and delta (r = 0.32) 
      electroencephalographic activities. A slower hot flash onset and a longer hot flash 
      duration were associated with greater polysomnographic impairments (r = -0.50 to 
      0.48). Greater sleep disturbances were found during hot flash onset or hot flash 
      plateau as compared with the pre-hot flash period (greater percentage of wake time, 
      lower percentage of stage II sleep, and lower percentage of rapid eye movement 
      sleep, all P values < 0.05). The probability that a stage change to a lighter sleep 
      occurred was significantly greater during hot flash onset (11%) than during hot 
      flash plateau (6%; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the speed and 
      duration of hot flashes would contribute more importantly to sleep alterations than 
      hot flash frequency. Sleep disturbances tend to occur simultaneously with hot 
      flashes, suggesting that these two nocturnal symptoms are manifestations of a 
      higher-order mechanism involving the central nervous system.

AB  - Toxic metabolic encephalopathies (TMEs) present as an acute derangement in 
      consciousness, cognition and behavior, and can be brought about by various triggers, 
      including endocrine and metabolic disturbances, exogenous toxins, pain and 
      infection. Also referred to as "delirium" or "acute confusional states," TMEs are 
      characterized by (1) an altered level of consciousness and activity, (2) global 
      changes in cognition with inattention, (3) a fluctuating course with disturbances in 
      the sleep-wake cycle, and (4) asterixis and myoclonus. The pathophysiology of this 
      syndrome is poorly understood. Imbalanced neurotransmitter signaling and 
      pathologically heightened brain inflammatory cytokine signaling have been proposed 
      as candidate mechanisms. Focal brain lesions can also occasionally mimic TMEs. A 
      neurological examination is required to identify the presence of focal findings, 
      which when present, identify a new focal lesion or the recrudescence of prior 
      ischemic, inflammatory or neoplastic insults. Diagnostic testing must include a 
      search for metabolic and infectious derangements. Offending medications should be 
      withdrawn. Magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and 
      electroencephalography should be considered in select clinical situations. In 
      addition to being an unpleasant experience for the patient and family, this 
      condition is associated with extended hospital stays, increased mortality and high 
      costs. In individuals with diminished cognitive reserve, episodes of TME lead to an 
      accelerated decline in cognitive functioning. Starting with an illustrative case, 
      this paper provides a neurologist's approach to the diagnosis, differential 
      diagnosis and management of toxic metabolic encephalopathies.

TI  - [A one-year-old male infant with sleep-associated febrile myoclonus].
PG  - 314-7
AB  - Febrile myoclonus is a benign neurological symptom induced by fever. The 
      physiological mechanism is unknown. We herein report a 1 year and 7 months old male 
      patient with intermittent jerks of the whole body during a high fever caused by 
      acute otitis media. He experienced more than 50 jerks over a period of 2 days. The 
      jerks appeared only during sleep. He showed no impairment of consciousness and no 
      abnormalities in neurological examination, blood examination, electroencephalogram, 
      or brain MRI findings. We diagnosed him with febrile myoclonus. The myoclonic jerks 
      disappeared as the fever decreased without neurological sequelae. To the best of our 
      knowledge, febrile myoclonus only during sleep has never been reported. To clarify 
      the pathophysiology of febrile myoclonus, we should focus on the relationship 
      between the myoclonus and the sleep/awake states.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe our institutional experience with deep-brain stimulation 
      (DBS) used in the treatment of aggressive and disruptive behavior refractory to 
      conservative treatment. METHODS: With stereotactic methodology and under general 
      anesthesia, seven patients (from 2002 to 2010) were given DBS in the posterior 
      hypothalamic region, bilaterally, and with the aid of intraoperative microrecording. 
      RESULTS: Six of seven patients presented a clear reduction in the aggression and 
      disruptive bouts, with subsequent simplification of familiar management. 
      CONCLUSIONS: DBS of the posterior hypothalamic region could be an effective 
      treatment for patients affected by mental retardation in whom disruptive and 
      drug-refractory aggressive behavior coexists. Although several experimental data are 
      available on this target, further studies are necessary to confirm the long-term 
      efficacy and safety of this procedure.

AB  - The aim of this study is to validate the Italian version of the Pittsburgh Sleep 
      Quality Index (PSQI), comparing five different groups of individuals (healthy young 
      and elderly, sleep apnoea syndrome patients, depressed patients, individuals with 
      dementia) by both questionnaire scores and polysomnographic measures. Fifty 
      individuals (10 for each group) participated in the study. Each of them filled in 
      the PSQI and slept for two consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. The PSQI 
      showed an overall reliability coefficient (Cronbach's α) of 0.835, indicating a high 
      degree of internal consistency. The mean PSQI global score showed significant 
      differences between groups, with an impaired overall quality of sleep in patients' 
      groups with respect to both the healthy groups. Results also indicated that the best 
      cut-off score (differentiating "good" from "bad" sleepers) is 5. Pittsburgh Sleep 
      Quality Index is a useful, valid and reliable tool for the assessment of sleep 
      quality, with an overall efficiency comparable to the mother language version and 
      differentiate "good" from "bad" sleepers. The Italian version of the questionnaire 
      provides a good and reliable differentiation between normal and pathological groups, 
      with higher scores reported by people characterized by impaired objectively 
      evaluated sleep quality.

AB  - N(6)-(3-methoxyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) adenine riboside (B2) is an N(6)-substitued 
      adenosine analog. Previous studies have shown that B2 binds to the adenosine A1 and 
      A2A receptors with moderate affinity and produces protective effects on serum 
      deprivation-induced cell damage. However, central nervous system effects of B2 have 
      not been studied. We aimed to investigate the sedative and hypnotic effects and the 
      mechanism of action of B2 in mice. Our behavioral studies showed that oral 
      administration of B2 decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and potentiated the 
      hypnotic effect of pentobarbital in mice. Sleep architecture analyses revealed that 
      B2 decreased wakefulness and increased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in both 
      normal mice and mice with caffeine-induced insomnia. Using immunohistochemistry, we 
      showed that B2 increased c-Fos expression, a cellular marker for neuronal activity, 
      in the ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) area, a sleep center in the anterior 
      hypothalamus. Altogether, these results indicate that oral administration of B2 
      produces sedative and hypnotic effects. Furthermore, the activation of VLPO neurons 
      may be involved in the central depressant effects of B2.

AB  - Clinical experience suggests that restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic leg 
      movement (PLM), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may co-occur in 
      both children and adults. The purpose of the present study was to provide an 
      electrocorticography and electromyography evaluation of the spontaneously 
      hypertensive rat (SHR) to investigate the potential of this rat strain as an animal 
      model of RLS-PLM. Initial work focused on evaluating sleep patterns and limb 
      movements during sleep in SHR, having normotensive Wistar rats (NWR) as control, 
      followed by comparison of two treatments (pharmacological-dopaminergic agonist 
      treatment and nonpharmacological-chronic physical exercise), known to be clinically 
      beneficial for sleep-related movement disorders. The captured data strengthen the 
      association between SHR and RLS-PLM, revealing a significant reduction on sleep 
      efficiency and slow wave sleep and an increase on wakefulness and limb movements for 
      the SHR group during the dark period, as compared to the NWR group, effects that 
      have characteristics that are strikingly consistent with RLS-PLM. The 
      pharmacological and nonpharmacological manipulations validated these results. The 
      present findings suggest that the SHR may be a useful putative animal model to study 
      sleep-related movement disorders mechanisms.

AB  - Brain histamine is involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle and alertness. 
      Despite the widespread use of the mouse as an experimental model, the periodic 
      properties of major markers of the mouse histaminergic system have not been 
      comprehensively characterized. We analysed the daily levels of histamine and its 
      first metabolite, 1-methylhistamine, in different brain structures of C57BL/6J and 
      CBA/J mouse strains, and the mRNA level and activity of histidine decarboxylase and 
      histamine-N-methyltransferase in C57BL/6J mice. In the C57BL/6J strain, histamine 
      release, assessed by in vivo microdialysis, underwent prominent periodic changes. 
      The main period was 24 h peaking during the activity period. Additional 8 h periods 
      were also observed. The release was highly positively correlated with active 
      wakefulness, as shown by electroencephalography. In both mouse strains, tissue 
      histamine levels remained steady for 24 h in all structures except for the 
      hypothalamus of CBA/J mice, where 24-h periodicity was observed. Brain tissue 
      1-methylhistamine levels in both strains reached their maxima in the periods of 
      activity. The mRNA level of histidine decarboxylase in the tuberomamillary nucleus 
      and the activities of histidine decarboxylase and histamine-N-methyltransferase in 
      the striatum and cortex did not show a 24-h rhythm, whereas in the hypothalamus the 
      activities of both enzymes had a 12-h periodicity. These results show that the 
      activities of histamine-metabolizing enzymes are not under simple direct circadian 
      regulation. The complex and non-uniform temporal patterns of the histaminergic 
      system of the mouse brain suggest that histamine is strongly involved in the 
      maintenance of active wakefulness.

TI  - GRIN2A mutations in acquired epileptic aphasia and related childhood focal 
      epilepsies and encephalopathies with speech and language dysfunction.
PG  - 1061-6
LID - 10.1038/ng.2726 [doi]
AB  - Epileptic encephalopathies are severe brain disorders with the epileptic component 
      contributing to the worsening of cognitive and behavioral manifestations. Acquired 
      epileptic aphasia (Landau-Kleffner syndrome, LKS) and continuous spike and waves 
      during slow-wave sleep syndrome (CSWSS) represent rare and closely related childhood 
      focal epileptic encephalopathies of unknown etiology. They show electroclinical 
      overlap with rolandic epilepsy (the most frequent childhood focal epilepsy) and can 
      be viewed as different clinical expressions of a single pathological entity situated 
      at the crossroads of epileptic, speech, language, cognitive and behavioral 
      disorders. Here we demonstrate that about 20% of cases of LKS, CSWSS and 
      electroclinically atypical rolandic epilepsy often associated with speech impairment 
      can have a genetic origin sustained by de novo or inherited mutations in the GRIN2A 
      gene (encoding the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor α2 subunit, 
      GluN2A). The identification of GRIN2A as a major gene for these epileptic 
      encephalopathies provides crucial insights into the underlying pathophysiology.

AB  - It has been established that sleep deprivation (SD) reduces the proliferation of 
      neuronal precursors in the adult hippocampus. It has also been reported that 
      psychostimulant drugs modulate adult neurogenesis. We examined the modulatory role 
      of two psychostimulant drugs modafinil and caffeine on adult neuronal cell 
      proliferation (NCP) during 48 h of total SD. A novel automated cage shaking stimulus 
      was used to induce SD based on animal activity. 5-Bromo-2″-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 
      50mg/kg/day i.p.) was injected at the onset of the light phase for two days. Rats 
      were successfully sleep deprived for 85-94% of total time. Stereological analysis 
      showed that both caffeine and modafinil treatments during SD improved the number of 
      BrdU positive cells as compared to the SD group. Caffeine treatment during SD, 
      significantly increased early proliferative and post-mitotic stages of doublecortin 
      (DCX) positive cells while modafinil treatment during SD, increased intermediate and 
      post-mitotic stages of DCX positive cells compared to SD+Vehicle group. 
      Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expression on BrdU positive cells as well 
      as in the dentate gyrus (DG) region was decreased significantly after sleep 
      deprivation. Both caffeine and modafinil significantly improved BDNF expression in 
      the DG region. Modafinil, but not caffeine, significantly decreased hippocampal 
      adenosine level during SD in comparison to the SD+Vehicle group. It may be concluded 
      that caffeine or modafinil treatment during 48 h of SD prevents the SD induced 
      decline in neuronal proliferation and differentiation. Caffeine and modafinil 
      induced alterations of NCP during SD may involve modulation of BDNF and adenosine 
      levels.

AB  - The Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) is widely distributed 
      in the brain with dense expression in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal 
      ganglia. These receptors have been implicated in psychiatric and neurological 
      disorders such as schizophrenia, Fragile X syndrome, addiction, anxiety/depression, 
      Parkinson's disease and neuropathic pain. The present study evaluated the effects of 
      the mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) 
      4-difluoromethoxy-3-(pyridine-2-ylethynyl)phenyl)5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-6(7H)-yl 
      methanone (GRN-529) and methyl 
      (3aR,4S,7aR)-4-hydroxy-4-[(3-methylphenyl)ethynyl]octahydro-1H-indole-1-carboxylate 
      (AFQ056) on polysomnographic (PSG) and quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) 
      measures in freely moving rats. Furthermore, the anxiolytic profile of GRN-529 was 
      characterized in anesthetized rats by measuring stimulation-induced hippocampal 
      theta oscillation. The present findings demonstrate that inhibition of mGluR5 via 
      its allosteric site profoundly modulates high-level neuronal network activities as 
      indicated by changes in sleep-wake activity and power distribution of qEEG. Both 
      GRN-529 and AFQ056 reduced the total time spent in rapid-eye movement with AFQ056 
      producing a significant increase in wakefulness at the highest dose tested. 
      Additionally, qEEG revealed significant compound-induced increases in delta power 
      concomitant with more subtle decreases in theta and alpha band power. Receptor 
      occupancy (RO) studies revealed that GRN-529 and AFQ056 at all doses resulted in 
      over 45% mGluR5 occupancy. Furthermore, GRN-529 dose-dependently decreased 
      elicited hippocampal theta frequency, consistent with previous findings using 
      clinically active anxiolytic compounds. The described changes in neurophysiological 
      signals identified in freely moving rats may be considered suitable translational 
      biomarkers for the clinical evaluation of mGluR5 NAMs.

TI  - Dopamine transporter shown by SPECT in patients with periodic leg movement after 
      acute physical exercise.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate dopamine transporter (DAT) density in patients 
      with periodic leg movement (PLM) shown by [(99mt)Tc]TRODAT-1 single-photon emission 
      computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and to determine the influence of acute physical 
      exercise (maximal exercise test [MET]) on DAT densities. METHODS: Sixteen healthy 
      male volunteers between 45 and 65 yr of age were selected to participate in the 
      study. Each subject (eight subjects in the control group and eight subjects in the 
      patients with PLM experimental group) underwent baseline polysomnography (PSG) to 
      evaluate sleep patterns and PLM index values. After obtaining PSG baselines, SPECT 
      baselines were determined using [(99mt)Tc]TRODAT-1, a selective DAT imaging ligand. 
      Subsequently, the volunteers performed the MET in the morning, followed by a SPECT 2 
      h later and PSG that night to assess the effect of acute physical exercise on DAT 
      and sleep patterns. RESULTS: The baseline SPECT results showed marginally 
      significantly lower DAT densities in the striatal region of the experimental group. 
      After the MET, no significant differences were observed between groups. The results 
      also showed a significant reduction in the PLM index in the experimental group and a 
      significantly increased percentage of stage 1 non-REM sleep in both groups after 
      MET. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that patients with PLM had a marginally lower DAT 
      density in the left putamen region compared with the control group. Although the 
      effect of acute physical exercise (MET) reduced PLM symptoms, the results suggest 
      that this improvement was not due to DAT availability.

TI  - Calcium regulation of neural rhythms, memory and Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 281-93
LID - 10.1113/jphysiol.2013.257527 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins with a decline in cognition followed by neuronal 
      cell death and dementia. These changes have been linked to a deregulation of Ca(2+) 
      signalling caused by a progressive increase in the resting level of Ca(2+), which 
      may influence cognition by interfering with the rhythm rheostat that controls the 
      sleep/wake cycle. The rise in resting levels of Ca(2+) may not alter the processes 
      of memory acquisition during consciousness (gamma and theta rhythms), but may 
      duplicate some of the events that occur during the slow oscillations responsible for 
      the twin processes of memory consolidation and memory erasure that occur during 
      sleep. The persistent elevation in the resting level of Ca(2+) induced by an 
      accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) oligomers duplicates a similar small global elevation 
      normally restricted to the period of slow oscillations when memories are erased 
      during sleep. In AD, such a rapid erasure of memories soon after they are acquired 
      during the wake period means that they are not retained for consolidation during 
      sleep. The Aβ deregulates Ca(2+) signalling through direct effects on the neurons 
      and indirectly by inducing inflammatory responses in the microglia and astrocytes. 
      Some of these deleterious effects of Aβ may be alleviated by vitamin D.

TI  - The human leucocyte antigen DQB1*0602 allele is associated with 
      electroencephelograph differences in individuals with obstructive sleep apnoea

PG  - 217-22
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12005 [doi]
AB  - Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1*0602 allele, a well-known genetic risk factor for 
      narcolepsy, has been associated with sleep parameters in healthy subjects. We aimed 
      to assess the association of this allele with daytime sleepiness and altered sleep 
      electroencephalogram characteristics in the general population and in patients with 
      obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). Eight hundred and ninety-four individuals 
      from the Epidemiologic Study of Sleep were genotyped for the HLA DQB1*0602 allele. 
      Full-night polysomnography was performed, and daytime sleepiness was analysed 
      according to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. HLA-DQB1*0602 allele-positive and 
      -negative subjects in the general population, as well as in patients with OSAS, 
      exhibited similar sleep parameters and levels of daytime sleepiness. However, 
      spectral analysis showed that allele-positive individuals with OSAS exhibited higher 
      theta power during sleep Stage 1 (P < 0.05) in occipital derivations, and lower 
      delta power during sleep Stages 1 and 2 (P < 0.01) compared with individuals 
      negative for the allele, even after correction for potential confounders as age, 
      sex, body mass index and European ancestry. No significant differences in the 
      electroencephalogram variables were found in individuals without OSAS. The data 
      highlight the HLA-DQB1*0602 as a potential genetic factor influencing sleep 
      physiology in individuals diagnosed with OSAS.

TI  - The coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorders 
      in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 2120-9
LID - 10.1093/brain/awt152 [doi]
AB  - In Parkinson's disease, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is an early 
      non-dopaminergic syndrome with nocturnal violence and increased muscle tone during 
      rapid eye movement sleep that can precede Parkinsonism by several years. The 
      neuronal origin of rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in Parkinson's 
      disease is not precisely known; however, the locus subcoeruleus in the brainstem has 
      been implicated as this structure blocks muscle tone during normal rapid eye 
      movement sleep in animal models and can be damaged in Parkinson's disease. Here, we 
      studied the integrity of the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex in patients with 
      Parkinson's disease using combined neuromelanin-sensitive, structural and diffusion 
      magnetic resonance imaging approaches. We compared 24 patients with Parkinson's 
      disease and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 12 patients without rapid 
      eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and 19 age- and gender-matched healthy 
      volunteers. All subjects underwent clinical examination and characterization of 
      rapid eye movement sleep using video-polysomnography and multimodal imaging at 3 T. 
      Using neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, reduced signal intensity was evident in the 
      locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus area in patients with Parkinson's disease that was more 
      marked in patients with than those without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour 
      disorder. Reduced signal intensity correlated with the percentage of abnormally 
      increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep. The results confirmed that 
      this complex is affected in Parkinson's disease and showed a gradual relationship 
      between damage to this structure, presumably the locus subcoeruleus, and abnormal 
      muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, which is the cardinal marker of rapid 
      eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. In longitudinal studies, the technique may 
      also provide early markers of non-dopaminergic Parkinson's disease pathology to 
      predict the occurrence of Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Iron-deficiency anemia in infancy and poorer cognitive inhibitory control at age 10 
      years.
PG  - 453-8
LID - 10.1111/dmcn.12118 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) 
      in infancy on executive functioning at age 10 years, specifically inhibitory control 
      on the Go/No-Go task. We predicted that children who had IDA in infancy would show 
      poorer inhibitory control. METHOD: We assessed cognitive inhibitory control in 132 
      Chilean children (mean [SD] age 10 y [1 mo]): 69 children had IDA in infancy (45 
      males, 24 females) and 63 comparison children who did not have IDA (26 males, 37 
      females). Participants performed the Go/No-Go task with event-related potentials. 
      Group differences in behavioral (accuracy, reaction time) and electrophysiological 
      outcomes (N2 and P300 components) were analyzed using repeated-measures analyses of 
      variance. N2 and P300 are interpreted to reflect attention and resource allocation 
      respectively. RESULTS: Relative to comparison participants, children who had IDA in 
      infancy showed slower reaction time (mean [SE], 528.7 ms [14.2] vs 485.0 ms [15.0], 
      95% confidence interval [CI] for difference between groups 0.9-86.5); lower accuracy 
      (95.4% [0.5] vs 96.9% [0.6], 95% CI -3.0 to -0.1); longer latency to N2 peak (378.9 
      ms [4.9] vs 356.9 ms [5.0], 95% CI 7.5-36.6); and smaller P300 amplitude (4.5 μV 
      [0.8] vs 7.6 μV [0.9], 95% CI-5.5 to -0.5). INTERPRETATION: IDA in infancy was 
      associated with slower reaction times and poorer inhibitory control 8 to 9 years 
      after iron therapy. These findings are consistent with the long-lasting effects of 
      early IDA on myelination and/or prefrontal-striatal circuits where dopamine is the 
      major neurotransmitter.

AB  - Sleep disorders are highly prevalent in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
      and can significantly impair cognitive rehabilitation. No proven therapies exist to 
      mitigate the neurocognitive consequences of TBI. We show that mild brain injury in 
      mice causes a persistent inability to maintain wakefulness and decreases orexin 
      neuron activation during wakefulness. We gave mice a dietary supplement of 
      branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), precursors for de novo glutamate synthesis in 
      the brain. BCAA therapy reinstated activation of orexin neurons and improved wake 
      deficits in mice with mild brain injury. Our data suggest that dietary BCAA 
      intervention, acting in part through orexin, can ameliorate injury-induced sleep 
      disturbances and may facilitate cognitive rehabilitation after brain injury.

TI  - Auto-servoventilation in heart failure with sleep apnoea: a randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 1244-54
LID - 10.1183/09031936.00083312 [doi]
AB  - We tested the hypotheses that in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and 
      sleep disordered breathing (SDB) auto-servoventilation (ASV) improves cardiac 
      function and quality of life. Between March 2007 and September 2009, patients with 
      stable CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%) and SDB 
      (apnoea/hypopnoea index ≥ 20 events · h(-1)) were randomised to receive either ASV 
      (BiPAP ASV (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA), n=37) and optimal medical 
      management, or optimal medical management alone (n=35). Outcomes were assessed at 
      baseline and 12 weeks. The apnoea/hypopnoea index assessed with polysomnography 
      scored in one core laboratory was significantly more reduced in the ASV group (-39 ± 
      16 versus -1 ± 13 events · h(-1); p<0.001) with an average use of 4.5 ± 3.0 h · 
      day(-1). Both groups showed similar improvements of the primary end-point LVEF (+3.4 
      ± 5 versus +3.5 ± 6%; p=0.915) assessed with echocardiography. In the ASV group, 
      reduction of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was significantly 
      greater (-360 ± 569 versus +135 ± 625 ng · mL(-1); p=0.010). No differences were 
      observed between the groups in subjective quality of life. In patients with CHF and 
      SDB, ASV reduced NT-proBNP levels, but improvement of LVEF or quality of life was 
      not greater than in the control group. The data support that such patients can be 
      randomised in large-scale, long-term trials of positive airway pressure therapy 
      versus control to determine effects on cardiovascular outcome.

      evidence against a stress-related etiology.

AB  - An exaggerated response to emotional stimuli is among the many symptoms widely 
      reported by veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. These symptomologies have been 
      attributed to damage and dysfunction associated with deployment-related exposures. 
      We collected event-related potential data from 22 veterans meeting Haley criteria 
      for Gulf War (GW) Syndromes 1-3 and from 8 matched GW veteran controls, who were 
      deployed but not symptomatic, while they performed a visual three-condition oddball 
      task where images authenticated to be associated with the 1991 Persian Gulf War were 
      the distractor stimuli. Hyperarousal reported by ill veterans was significantly 
      greater than that by control veterans, but this was not paralleled by higher 
      amplitude P3a in their ERP responses to GW-related distractor stimuli. Whereas 
      previous studies of PTSD patients have shown higher amplitude P3b responses to 
      target stimuli that are placed amid trauma-related nontarget stimuli, ill veterans 
      in this study showed P3b amplitudes to target stimuli - placed amid GW-related 
      nontarget stimuli - that were significantly lower than those of the control group. 
      Hyperarousal scores reliably predicted P3b, but not P3a, amplitudes. Although many 
      factors may contribute to P3b amplitude differences - most notably depression and 
      poor sleep quality, symptoms that are prevalent in the GW syndrome groups - our 
      findings in context of previous studies on this population are consistent with the 
      contention that dysfunction in cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter 
      systems, and in white matter and basal ganglia may be contributing to impairments in 
      GW veterans.

AB  - This study compared cortical arousal mechanisms during the night using event-related 
      potentials (N1 and P2), and compared sleep misperception in 30 adults with 
      psychophysiological insomnia (Psy-I), 28 adults with paradoxical insomnia (Para-I), 
      and 30 good sleepers (GS). Participants (age range = 25-55 years) spent 4 
      consecutive nights in the laboratory, and Night-4 data were used for analysis. N1 
      amplitude was generally larger in both insomnia groups compared to GS, and P2 
      amplitude was larger in Para-I than in the 2 other groups, especially in REM sleep. 
      Results suggest that, although hyperarousal appears to persist during sleep in 
      adults with insomnia, inhibition deficits are more likely to be present in Para-I 
      compared to Psy-I.

TI  - A proposal of new diagnostic pathway for fatal familial insomnia.
PG  - 654-9
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2013-305978 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In absence of a positive family history, the diagnosis of fatal familial 
      insomnia (FFI) might be difficult because of atypical clinical features and low 
      sensitivity of diagnostic tests. FFI patients usually do not fulfil the established 
      classification criteria for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD); therefore, a prion 
      disease is not always suspected. OBJECTIVE: To propose an update of diagnostic 
      pathway for the identification of patients for the analysis of D178-M129 mutation. 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on 41 German FFI patients were analysed. Clinical symptoms 
      and signs, MRI, PET, SPECT, polysomnography, EEG and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers 
      were studied. RESULTS: An algorithm was developed which correctly identified at 
      least 81% of patients with the FFI diagnosis during early disease stages. It is 
      based on the detection of organic sleep disturbances, either verified clinically or 
      by a polysomnography, and a combination of vegetative and focal neurological signs 
      and symptoms. Specificity of the approach was tested on three cohorts of patients 
      (MM1 sporadic CJD patients, non-selected sporadic CJD and other neurodegenerative 
      diseases). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed scheme may help to improve the clinical 
      diagnosis of FFI. As the sensitivity of all diagnostic tests investigated but 
      polysomnography is low in FFI, detailed clinical investigation is of special 
      importance.

AB  - Low-frequency oscillations in cerebral blood flow that are suggestive of 
      resting-state brain activity have recently been reported, but no study on the 
      development of resting-state brain activity in preterm infants has been performed. 
      The objective of this study was to measure the cerebral blood flow oscillations, 
      which are assumed to represent brain function in the resting state, in preterm and 
      term infants of the same postconceptional age. The subjects were 9 preterm infants 
      who had reached full term (gestational age (GA): 23-34 weeks, postconceptional age: 
      37-46 weeks) and 10 term infants (GA: 37-40 weeks, postconceptional age: 37-41 
      weeks). Their changes in concentration of oxyhemoglobin ([oxyHb]) and 
      deoxyhemoglobin ([deoxyHb]) were measured in the parieto-temporal region during 
      quiet sleep using multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy, and the power spectral 
      densities (PSD) of the oscillations in the concentrations of these molecules were 
      analyzed and compared. The preterm infants displayed a higher proportion of 
      0.06-0.10 Hz low frequency oscillations of [oxyHb] and [deoxyHb] than the term 
      infants, and the gestational age and the proportion of low frequency oscillations 
      were inversely correlated. These findings suggest that resting-state cerebral blood 
      flow oscillations differ between preterm and term infants, and that the development 
      of circulatory regulation and nerve activity in preterm infants are influenced by 
      the extrauterine environment.

TI  - Insights into sleep's role for insight: Studies with the number reduction task.
PG  - 160-72
LID - 10.2478/v10053-008-0143-8 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, vibrant research has developed on "consolidation" during sleep: To 
      what extent are newly experienced impressions reprocessed or even restructured 
      during sleep? We used the number reduction task (NRT) to study if and how sleep does 
      not only reiterate new experiences but may even lead to new insights. In the NRT, 
      covert regularities may speed responses. This implicit acquisition of regularities 
      may become explicitly conscious at some point, leading to a qualitative change in 
      behavior which reflects this insight. By applying the NRT at two consecutive 
      sessions separated by an interval, we investigated the role of sleep in this 
      interval for attaining insight at the second session. In the first study, a night of 
      sleep was shown to triple the number of participants attaining insight above the 
      base rate of about 20%. In the second study, this hard core of 20% discoverers 
      differed from other participants in their task-related EEG potentials from the very 
      beginning already. In the third study, the additional role of sleep was specified as 
      an effect of the deep-sleep phase of slow-wave sleep on participants who had 
      implicitly acquired the covert regularity before sleep. It was in these participants 
      that a specific increase of EEG during slow-wave sleep in the 10-12 Hz band was 
      obtained. These results support the view that neuronal memory reprocessing during 
      slow-wave sleep restructures task-related representations in the brain, and that 
      such restructuring promotes the gain of explicit knowledge.

AB  - Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare sleep disorder, predominantly affecting 
      adolescent males, which presents as recurrent episodes of hypersomnia, behavioral 
      and cognitive disturbances, hyperphagia and sometimes hypersexuality (Lisk, 
      "Kleine-Levin syndrome." Pract Neurol 2009;9:42-45). Modafinil has been reported to 
      show an effect in shortening the duration of symptomatic periods, but does not 
      affect the recurrence rate (Huang et al., "Kleine-Levin syndrome: current status." 
      Med Clin N Am 2010;94:557-562). However, no single drug therapy has been 
      consistently successful, despite various psychotropic agents, including lithium, 
      anticonvulsants and antidepressants, having been systematically tried (Arnulf et 
      al., "Kleine-Levin syndrome: a systematic study of 108 patients." Ann Neurol 
      2008;63:482-492). This study reports a male adolescent with KLS who received several 
      courses of drug therapy, providing a chance to compare differential drug effects 
      over time.

AB  - We introduced a low glycemic index treatment using Japanese ethnic foods to a 
      13-year-old girl with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome caused by tuberous sclerosis complex. 
      She had previously refused the modified Atkins diet within 2 weeks of diet treatment 
      because of its restrictiveness. The low glycemic index treatment was implemented by 
      limiting the daily carbohydrate intake to 50 g of foods with a glycemic index of 
      less than 50 relative to that of glucose, which included udon, soba, and unpolished 
      Japonica rice with natto. One month after the initiation of the diet therapy, the 
      clusters of tonic seizures for 30 to 60 minutes during sleep were reduced from two 
      or three times per week to once or twice per month, and the frequent myoclonic 
      seizures in the awake state disappeared. She has been on the diet therapy for more 
      than 1 year, and the efficacy of the diet has been sustained. Low glycemic index 
      treatment should be considered for patients with medication-resistant epilepsy who 
      cannot tolerate restrictive diet therapies. Japanese ethnic foods can be used for 
      this diet therapy.

TI  - [Clinical and genetic characteristics of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency 
      syndrome].
PG  - 443-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical and SLC2A1 gene mutation characteristics of 
      glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome. METHOD: The detailed clinical 
      manifestations of six cases were recorded. The laboratory tests including EEG, MRI, 
      blood chemistry, and lumbar puncture were performed. SLC2A1 gene mutations were 
      analyzed by PCR, DNA sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification 
      (MLPA). RESULT: Patient 1, 2 and 3 had classical clinical symptoms including 
      infantile onset seizures, development delay. Patient 4, 5 and 6 had non-classical 
      clinical symptoms including paroxysmal behavior disturbance, weakness, ataxia, 
      lethargy, especially after fasting or exercise, without severe seizures. The plasma 
      glucose levels were normal. The CSF glucose levels decreased in all the six cases, 
      ranged from 1.10 mmol/L to 2.45 mmol/L, the mean level was 1.68 mmol/L. The CSF 
      glucose/plasma glucose ratios decreased, ranged from 0.16 to 0.51, the mean ratio 
      was 0.34. Four patients had normal EEG. Two patients had focal and diffuse 
      epileptiform discharge, and one of them also had paroxysmal occipital or generalized 
      high-amplitude slow waves during awake and sleep time. MRI abnormalities were found 
      in three patients, patient 1 with mild brain atrophy, patient 3 with bilateral 
      ventricle plump, and patient 4 with high signals in T2 in the frontal and occipital 
      white matter, interpreted as hypomyelination. SLC2A1 gene mutations were found in 
      six cases. Patient 1 has large scale deletion in exon 2. In patient 2 to 6, the 
      mutations were c.741 G>A (E247K), 599delA, 761delA, c.1148 C>A (P383H), c.1198 C>T 
      (R400C) respectively. Two patients were treated with ketogenic diet. The seizures 
      disappeared and development became normal. Three patients responded to frequent 
      meals with snacks. One patient refused any treatments, the symptoms continued to 
      exist. CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations of glucose transporter type 1 
      deficiency syndrome are varied. The common symptoms included infantile onset 
      seizures and various paroxysmal events. These neurologic symptoms generally 
      fluctuated and were influenced by factors such as fasting or fatigue. This feature 
      could be a very important clue for the diagnosis of GLUT1-DS. Lumbar puncture is 
      recommended in patients with episodic CNS symptoms especially after fasting. 
      GLUT1-DS is a treatable neurometabolic disorder, early diagnosis and treatment may 
      improve the prognosis of the patients.

TI  - Epilepsy in Mowat-Wilson syndrome: delineation of the electroclinical phenotype.
PG  - 273-84
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35717 [doi]
AB  - Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a genetic disease caused by heterozygous mutations or 
      deletions of the ZEB2 gene and is characterized by distinctive facial features, 
      epilepsy, moderate to severe intellectual disability, corpus callosum abnormalities 
      and other congenital malformations. Epilepsy is considered a main manifestation of 
      the syndrome, with a prevalence of about 70-75%. In order to delineate the 
      electroclinical phenotype of epilepsy in MWS, we investigated epilepsy onset and 
      evolution, including seizure types, EEG features, and response to anti-epileptic 
      therapies in 22 patients with genetically confirmed MWS. Onset of seizures occurred 
      at a median age of 14.5 months (range: 1-108 months). The main seizure types were 
      focal and atypical absence seizures. In all patients the first seizure was a focal 
      seizure, often precipitated by fever. The semiology was variable, including 
      hypomotor, versive, or focal clonic manifestations; frequency ranged from daily to 
      sporadic. Focal seizures were more frequent during drowsiness and sleep. In 13 
      patients, atypical absence seizures appeared later in the course of the disease, 
      usually after the age of 4 years. Epilepsy was usually quite difficult to treat: 
      seizure freedom was achieved in nine out of the 20 treated patients. At epilepsy 
      onset, the EEGs were normal or showed only mild slowing of background activity. 
      During follow-up, irregular, diffuse frontally dominant and occasionally asymmetric 
      spike and waves discharges were seen in most patients. Sleep markedly activated 
      these abnormalities, resulting in continuous or near-to-continuous spike and wave 
      activity during slow wave sleep. Slowing of background activity and poverty of 
      physiological sleep features were seen in most patients. Our data suggest that a 
      distinct electroclinical phenotype, characterized by focal and atypical absence 
      seizures, often preceded by febrile seizures, and age-dependent EEG changes, can be 
      recognized in most patients with MWS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the electroclinical features and 
      surgical outcome of 31 pediatric patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type 
      II. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study of 31 
      patients with FCD type II followed between 1998 and 2011. We included patients with 
      FCD type II confirmed by histopathological examination with abnormal magnetic 
      resonance imaging and at least 1 year of follow-up. RESULTS: All patients had severe 
      focal epilepsy; in infancy, four of them had also had epileptic spasms, associated 
      with hypsarrhythmia in three. Focal status epilepticus occurred in five patients 
      (16 %) and epilepsia partialis continua in one (3.2 %). Seizures occurred during 
      sleep in 20 (64.5 %) and in clusters in 19 (61.3 %) patients. Neurological 
      examination showed a mild motor deficit in seven (22.8 %) patients. Interictal 
      abnormalities were characterized by rhythmic spikes and polyspike discharges, 
      increasing during sleep in 13 (41.9 %) patients. Average time of follow-up after 
      surgery was 4.7 years with a median time of 4 years and a range from 1 to 9 years. 
      Engel classification class I was found in 20 (67.7 %) and class II in 3 cases 
      (9.6 %). There were no significant changes after an average time of follow-up of 
      4.7 years. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that surgery is the best treatment option 
      for pediatric patients with refractory focal epilepsy due to type II FCD. A 
      statistically significant correlation was found between a good prognosis and age at 
      epilepsy onset older than 2 years.

AB  - Sleep disorders significantly affect the lives of children with epilepsy. Limited 
      data exist about provider practices concerning detection and correct diagnosis of 
      sleep problems in epilepsy. The authors conducted this study to identify and 
      correlate sleep screening methods, referral practices, referral reasons and final 
      sleep diagnoses. They identified that 94% of the providers who had referred patients 
      to the sleep center of a major children's hospital used routine screening and 70% of 
      them used 2 to 3 screening questions. This method, however, underidentified the 
      patients at risk for sleep disorders. Moreover, in 40% of the children, sleep 
      disorder was incorrectly anticipated, based on the initial symptoms. Of these 
      children, 10% had no sleep disorder and 30% had unexpected sleep disorder. The 
      authors conclude that better screening methods should be used for sleep disorders. 
      Once identified, these patients should have formal sleep evaluation and management. 
      Further studies are needed to develop screening questionnaires.

AB  - The transgenic rat strain S284L-TG harbors the S284L mutant of the neuronal 
      nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 subunit gene (CHRNA4), which is responsible 
      for human autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). S284L-TG rats 
      have epileptic seizure phenotypes during slow-wave sleep, similar to those in NFLE. 
      We previously demonstrated that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic action of these rats 
      was suppressed before the onset of ADNFLE seizures, and that glutamate release in 
      the epileptic focus lesion was increased at the onset of epilepsy. Here, mRNA 
      analysis revealed that Cl(-)-accumulating Na-K-2Cl cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) levels 
      were increased and Cl(-)-extruding K-Cl cotransporter 1 and 2 (KCC1 and KCC2) levels 
      were decreased at the onset of ADNFLE seizures in S284L-TG rat frontal cortexes, 
      which perturbed the GABAergic inhibitory system. The reversal potentials (EGABA) of 
      GABAA receptor-mediated currents in cortical layer V pyramidal neurons of S284L-TG 
      rats also changed their polarity from hyperpolarization to depolarization, and 
      S284L-TG miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), but not miniature 
      inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), significantly increased in both amplitude 
      and frequency. Administration of 25mg/kg/day furosemide before, but not after, the 
      onset of interictal discharges prevented idiopathic epileptic activity, reversed the 
      depolarizing shift of EGABA and increased mEPSC amplitude to normal levels. These 
      data indicate that early treatment with an agent that normalizes pathogenesis has a 
      prophylactic effect on epilepsy. We propose a strategy for prophylactic medication 
      against idiopathic epilepsy through the suppression of epileptogenesis and/or 
      ictogenesis.

AB  - Psychological stressors prominently affect diurnal rhythms, including locomotor 
      activity, sleep, blood pressure, and body temperature, in humans. Here, we found 
      that a novel continuous stress imposed by the perpetual avoidance of water on a 
      wheel (PAWW) affected several physiological diurnal rhythms in mice. One week of 
      PAWW stress decayed robust circadian locomotor rhythmicity, while locomotor activity 
      was evident even during the light period when the mice are normally asleep. Daytime 
      activity was significantly upregulated, whereas nighttime activity was 
      downregulated, resulting in a low amplitude of activity. Total daily activity 
      gradually decreased with increasing exposure to PAWW stress. The mice could be 
      exposed to PAWW stress for over 3 weeks without adaptation. Furthermore, continuous 
      PAWW stress enhanced food intake, but decreased body weight and plasma leptin 
      levels, indicating that sleep loss and PAWW stress altered the energy balance in 
      these mice. The diurnal rhythm of corticosterone levels was not severely affected. 
      The body temperature rhythm was diurnal in the stressed mice, but significantly 
      dysregulated during the dark period. Plasma catecholamines were elevated in the 
      stressed mice. Continuous PAWW stress reduced the duration of daytime sleep, 
      especially during the first half of the light period, and increased nighttime 
      sleepiness. Continuous PAWW stress also simultaneously obscured sleep/wake and 
      locomotor activity rhythms compared with control mice. These sleep architecture 
      phenotypes under stress are similar to those of patients with insomnia. The stressed 
      mice could be entrained to the light/dark cycle, and when they were transferred to 
      constant darkness, they exhibited a free-running circadian rhythm with a timing of 
      activity onset predicted by the phase of their entrained rhythms. Circadian gene 
      expression in the liver and muscle was unaltered, indicating that the peripheral 
      clocks in these tissues remained intact.

      arousal and reinstate drug-seeking.
PG  - 63-75
LID - 10.1017/S1461145713000734 [doi]
AB  - Psychostimulants, including amphetamine (AMPH), exert robust arousal-enhancing, 
      reinforcing and locomotor-activating effects. These behavioural actions involve 
      drug-induced elevations in extracellular norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) 
      within a variety of cortical and subcortical regions. The lateral hypothalamic area 
      (LHA), including the lateral hypothalamus proper, perifornical area and adjacent 
      dorsomedial hypothalamus, is implicated in appetitive- and arousal-related 
      processes. The LHA is innervated by both NE and DA projections and systemically 
      administered AMPH has been demonstrated to activate LHA neurons. Combined, these and 
      other observations suggest the LHA may be a site of action in the behavioural 
      effects of psychostimulants. To test this hypothesis, we examined the degree to 
      which AMPH (10 nmol, 25 nmol) acts within the LHA to exert arousing, 
      locomotor-activating and reinforcing actions in quietly resting/sleeping rats. 
      Although intra-LHA AMPH robustly increased time spent awake, this occurred in the 
      absence of pronounced locomotor activation or reinforcing actions, as measured in a 
      conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Arousing and stressful conditions or 
      drug re-exposure can elicit relapse in humans and reinstate drug-seeking in animals. 
      Given the LHA is also implicated in the reinstatement of drug-seeking behaviour, 
      additional studies examined whether AMPH acts within the LHA to reinstate an 
      extinguished CPP produced with systemic AMPH administration. Our results demonstrate 
      that AMPH action within the LHA is sufficient to reinstate drug-seeking behaviour, 
      as measured in this paradigm. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that 
      psychostimulants act within the LHA to elicit affectively neutral arousal and 
      reinstate drug-seeking behaviour.

TI  - Prospective Study of the Emfit Movement Monitor.
PG  - 1434-1436
AB  - Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is associated with generalized 
      tonic-clonic seizures and occurs most often when patients are in bed. There are 
      several seizure detection monitors on the market, but little data are available on 
      the sensitivity and specificity of these devices. We recently tested 2 models of 
      seizure detection alarms with disappointing results. Here we tested the Emfit 
      movement monitor on children with various seizure types who also had standard video 
      electroencephalography (EEG), cardiopulmonary, and nursing monitoring. Video EEG 
      records were reviewed to detect any seizures. In 45 patients, 78 seizures were 
      recorded by video EEG. The Emfit movement monitor captured 23 seizure events (30%) 
      in total, and 15 of the 28 (54%) that occurred during sleep. Most importantly, the 
      alarm was activated with 11 of the 13 (85%) generalized tonic-clonic seizures that 
      occurred in sleeping children. The Emfit movement monitor performed very well in 
      comparison to previously tested devices.

TI  - Chronic agomelatine treatment corrects the abnormalities in the circadian rhythm of 
      motor activity and sleep/wake cycle induced by prenatal restraint stress in adult 
      rats.
PG  - 323-38
LID - 10.1017/S1461145711001970 [doi]
AB  - Agomelatine is a novel antidepressant acting as an MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor 
      agonist/5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist. Because of its peculiar 
      pharmacological profile, this drug caters the potential to correct the abnormalities 
      of circadian rhythms associated with mood disorders, including abnormalities of the 
      sleep/wake cycle. Here, we examined the effect of chronic agomelatine treatment on 
      sleep architecture and circadian rhythms of motor activity using the rat model of 
      prenatal restraint stress (PRS) as a putative 'aetiological' model of depression. 
      PRS was delivered to the mothers during the last 10 d of pregnancy. The adult 
      progeny ('PRS rats') showed a reduced duration of slow wave sleep, an increased 
      duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increased number of REM sleep events 
      and an increase in motor activity before the beginning of the dark phase of the 
      light/dark cycle. In addition, adult PRS rats showed an increased expression of the 
      transcript of the primary response gene, c-Fos, in the hippocampus just prior to the 
      beginning of the dark phase. All these changes were reversed by a chronic oral 
      treatment with agomelatine (2000 ppm in the diet). The effect of agomelatine on 
      sleep was largely attenuated by treatment with the MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor 
      antagonist, S22153, which caused PRS-like sleep disturbances on its own. These data 
      provide the first evidence that agomelatine corrects sleep architecture and restores 
      circadian homeostasis in a preclinical model of depression and supports the value of 
      agomelatine as a novel antidepressant that resynchronizes circadian rhythms under 
      pathological conditions.

TI  - Prospective Study of 2 Bed Alarms for Detection of Nocturnal Seizures.
PG  - 1430-1433
AB  - For parents of children with epilepsy, seizures occurring in sleep are a major 
      concern. Risk factors for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients include 
      being in bed and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A device for detecting nocturnal 
      seizure activity would be valuable. Children with various seizure types undergoing 
      evaluation had standard video electroencephalography (EEG), cardiopulmonary and 
      nursing monitoring, and 1 of 2 models (ST-2 and MP5) of a Medpage bed alarm. The 
      video EEG record was reviewed to detect any seizures missed by the bed alarms or 
      caregivers. The ability of the bed alarms to detect motor seizures in general and 
      specific seizure types was tested. In 15 patients, 69 seizures were recorded by 
      video EEG. The ST-2 did not detect any nocturnal seizures. The MP5 alarm detected 1 
      of 15 in sleeping patients: a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The Medpage seizure 
      alarms do not appear to adequately detect nocturnal seizures.

TI  - Sleep Inducing for EEG Recording in Children: A Comparison between Oral Midazolam 
      and Chloral Hydrate.
PG  - 15-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electroencephalography (EEG) recording is a long duration procedure that 
      needs patient's cooperation for device setup and performing the procedure. Many 
      children lose their cooperation during this procedure. Therefore, sedation and sleep 
      are frequently induced using a few agents as pre procedure medication in children 
      before EEG recording. We aimed to compare the sedative effects of oral midazolam 
      versus chloral hydrate before the procedure along with their impacts on EEG 
      recording in children. MATERIALS & METHODS: A randomized trial was carried out to 
      compare the sedative effects of oral midazolam versus chloral hydrate and their 
      impacts on EEG recording in children. A total of 198 children (100 in the midazolam 
      group and 98 in the chloral hydrate group) were enrolled in the study and randomly 
      allocated to receive either oral moidazolam or chloral hydrate. RESULTS: Oral 
      midazolam had superiority neither in sleep onset latency nor in sleep duration when 
      compared to chloral hydrate. Moreover, the yield of epileptiform discharges in the 
      chloral hydrate group was more than the midazolam group. CONCLUSION: The results of 
      this study showed that both chloral hydrate 5% (one ml/kg) and oral midazolam (0.5 
      mg/kg) could be administered as a pre medication agent for EEG recording in 
      children. However, oral midazolam at this dose had no advantage compared with 
      chloral hydrate.

TI  - The effect of alpha rhythm sleep on EEG activity and individuals' attention.
PG  - 1515-8
LID - 10.1589/jpts.25.1515 [doi]
AB  - [Purpose] This study examined whether the alpha rhythm sleep alters the EEG activity 
      and response time in the attention and concentration tasks. [Subjects and Methods] 
      The participants were 30 healthy university students, who were randomly and equally 
      divided into two groups, the experimental and control groups. They were treated 
      using the Happy-sleep device or a sham device, respectively. All participants had a 
      one-week training period. Before and after training sessions, a behavioral task test 
      was performed and EEG alpha waves were measured to confirm the effectiveness of 
      training on cognitive function. [Results] In terms of the behavioral task test, 
      reaction time (RT) variations in the experimental group were significantly larger 
      than in the control group for the attention item. Changes in the EEG alpha power in 
      the experimental group were also significantly larger than those of the control 
      group. [Conclusions] These findings suggest that sleep induced using the Happy-sleep 
      device modestly enhances the ability to pay attention and focus during academic 
      learning.

AB  - The orexin neuropeptide system regulates wakefulness and contributes to 
      physiological and behavioral stress responses. Moreover, a role for orexins in 
      modulating hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity has been proposed. 
      Brain penetrating dual orexin receptor (OXR) antagonists such as almorexant decrease 
      vigilance and have emerged as a novel therapeutic class for the treatment of 
      insomnia. Almorexant was used here as a pharmacological tool to examine the role of 
      endogenous orexin signaling in HPA axis endocrine function under natural conditions. 
      After confirming the expression of prepro-orexin and OXR-1 and OXR-2 mRNA in 
      hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal glands, the effects of systemic almorexant were 
      investigated on peripheral HPA axis hormone release in the rat under baseline, 
      stress and pharmacological challenge conditions. Almorexant did not alter basal or 
      stress-induced corticosterone release despite affecting wake and sleep stages 
      (detected by radiotelemetric electroencephalography/electromyography) during the 
      stress exposure. Moreover, almorexant did not affect the release of 
      adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone at different time points along the 
      diurnal rhythm, nor corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)- and ACTH-stimulated 
      neuroendocrine responses, measured in vivo under stress-free conditions. These 
      results illustrate that dual OXR antagonists, despite modulating stress-induced 
      wakefulness, do not interfere with endocrine HPA axis function in the rat. They 
      converge to suggest that endogenous orexin signaling plays a minor role in stress 
      hormone release under basal conditions and under challenge.

      operant responding in the rat.

AB  - The demonstrated functional interaction of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu₅) 
      receptors with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has prompted speculation that 
      their activation may offer a potential treatment for aspects of schizophrenia. 
      Development of selective mGlu₅ agonists has been difficult, but several different 
      positive allosteric modulator (PAM) molecules have now been identified. This study 
      describes two novel mGlu₅ PAMs, LSN2463359 
      (N-(1-methylethyl)-5-(pyridin-4-ylethynyl)pyridine-2-carboxamide) and LSN2814617 
      [(7S)-3-tert-butyl-7-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-A]pyridine], 
      which are useful tools for this field of research. Both compounds are potent and 
      selective potentiators of human and rat mGlu₅ receptors in vitro, displaying curve 
      shift ratios of two to three fold in the concentration-response relationship to 
      glutamate or the glutamate receptor agonist, DHPG, with no detectable intrinsic 
      agonist properties. Both compounds displaced the mGlu₅ receptor antagonist 
      radioligand, [³H]MPEP in vitro and, following oral administration reached brain 
      concentrations sufficient to occupy hippocampal mGlu₅ receptors as measured in vivo 
      by dose-dependent displacement from the hippocampus of intravenously administered 
      MPEPy. In vivo EEG studies demonstrated that these mGlu₅ PAMs have marked 
      wake-promoting properties but little in the way of rebound hypersomnolence. In 
      contrast, the previously described mGlu₅ PAMs CDPPB and ADX47273 showed relatively 
      poor evidence of in vivo target engagement in either receptor occupancy assays or 
      EEG disturbance. Wake-promoting doses of LSN2463359 and LSN2814617 attenuated 
      deficits in performance induced by the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist SDZ 
      220,581 in two tests of operant behaviour: the variable interval 30 s task and the 
      DMTP task. These effects were lost if the dose of either compound extended into the 
      range which disrupted performance in the baseline DMTP task. However, the 
      improvements in response accuracy induced by the mGlu₅ potentiators in SDZ 
      220,581-treated rats were not delay-dependent and, therefore, perhaps more likely 
      reflected optimization of general arousal than specific beneficial effects on 
      discrete cognitive processes. The systematic profiling of LSN2463359 and LSN2814617 
      alongside other previously described molecules will help determine more precisely 
      how mGlu₅ potentiator pharmacology might provide therapeutic benefit. This article 
      is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.

AB  - Coherent oscillations in the theta-to-gamma frequency range have been proposed as a 
      mechanism that coordinates neural activity in large-scale cortical networks in 
      sensory, motor, and cognitive tasks. Whether this mechanism also involves coherent 
      oscillations at delta frequencies (1-4 Hz) is not known. Rather, delta oscillations 
      have been associated with slow-wave sleep. Here, we show coherent oscillations in 
      the delta frequency band between parietal and frontal cortices during the 
      decision-making component of a somatosensory discrimination task. Importantly, the 
      magnitude of this delta-band coherence is modulated by the different decision 
      alternatives. Furthermore, during control conditions not requiring decision making, 
      delta-band coherences are typically much reduced. Our work indicates an important 
      role for synchronous activity in the delta frequency band when large-scale, distant 
      cortical networks coordinate their neural activity during decision making.

AB  - Succinic semialdehyde dehydrognase deficiency (SSADHD) is a neurometabolic disease 
      with autosomal recessive inheritance. Although only about 450 cases are known 
      worldwide, SSADHD is a frequent paediatric disorder of the neurotransmitter 
      metabolism. SSADHD is caused by a mutation of the Aldh5a1-gene resulting in a 
      dysfunction of the enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. This is followed by 
      an accumulation of γ-aminobutyric acid and succinic semialdehyde that is 
      alternatively metabolised via succinic semialdehyde reductase to γ-hydroxybutyric 
      acid. The clinical phenotype is unspecific with pronounced interindividual 
      variability. However, delayed acquisition of motor and language developmental 
      milestones as well as epilepsy, mental retardation, sleep disorder, ataxia, muscle 
      hypotonia, and behavioural disturbances are frequent. First symptoms frequently 
      occur in the first year of life while the general course of the disease is 
      non-progressive. Currently, no causal therapy exists.

AB  - In a previous study, we found that the low-level laser (LLL) stimulation at the palm 
      with a frequency of 10 Hz was able to induce significant brain activation in normal 
      subjects with opened eyes. However, the electroencephalography (EEG) changes to LLL 
      stimulation in subjects with closed eyes have not been studied. In the present 
      study, the laser array stimulator was applied to deliver insensible laser 
      stimulations to the palm of the tested subjects with closed eyes (the laser group). 
      The EEG activities before, during, and after the laser stimulation were collected. 
      The EEG amplitude powers of each EEG frequency band at 19 locations were calculated. 
      These power data were then analyzed by SPSS software using repeated-measure ANOVAs 
      and appropriate posthoc tests. We found a pronounced decrease in the EEG power in 
      alpha-bandwidth during laser simulation and then less decrease in the EEG power in 
      delta-bandwidth in normal subjects with laser stimulation. The EEG power in 
      beta-bandwidth in the right occipital area also decreased significantly in the laser 
      group. We suggest that LLL stimulation might be conducive to falling into sleep in 
      patients with sleep problems.

AB  - Studies in cognitive psychology showed that personality (openness to experience, 
      thin boundaries, absorption), creativity, nocturnal awakenings, and attitude toward 
      dreams are significantly related to dream recall frequency (DRF). These results 
      suggest the possibility of neurophysiological trait differences between subjects 
      with high and low DRF. To test this hypothesis we compared sleep characteristics and 
      alpha reactivity to sounds in subjects with high and low DRF using polysomnographic 
      recordings and electroencephalography (EEG). We acquired EEG from 21 channels in 36 
      healthy subjects while they were presented with a passive auditory oddball paradigm 
      (frequent standard tones, rare deviant tones and very rare first names) during 
      wakefulness and sleep (intensity, 50 dB above the subject's hearing level). Subjects 
      were selected as High-recallers (HR, DRF = 4.42 ± 0.25 SEM, dream recalls per week) 
      and Low-recallers (LR, DRF = 0.25 ± 0.02) using a questionnaire and an interview on 
      sleep and dream habits. Despite the disturbing setup, the subjects' quality of sleep 
      was generally preserved. First names induced a more sustained decrease in alpha 
      activity in HR than in LR at Pz (1000-1200 ms) during wakefulness, but no group 
      difference was found in REM sleep. The current dominant hypothesis proposes that 
      alpha rhythms would be involved in the active inhibition of the brain regions not 
      involved in the ongoing brain operation. According to this hypothesis, a more 
      sustained alpha decrease in HR would reflect a longer release of inhibition, 
      suggesting a deeper processing of complex sounds than in LR during wakefulness. A 
      possibility to explain the absence of group difference during sleep is that increase 
      in alpha power in HR may have resulted in awakenings. Our results support this 
      hypothesis since HR experienced more intra sleep wakefulness than LR (30 ± 4 vs. 14 
      ± 4 min). As a whole our results support the hypothesis of neurophysiological trait 
      differences in high and low-recallers.

TI  - Awakening effects of church bell noise: geographical extrapolation of the results of 
      a polysomnographic field study 1.

AB  - Based on a previously published exposure-effect model of Electroencephalography 
      (EEG)-awakening reactions (AWR) due to nightly church bell noise events, as well as 
      on geocoded building and population data, we estimated the total number of the 
      church bell noise induced awakenings on the population of the Canton of Zurich, in 
      Switzerland. The calculated mean number of EEG awakenings per person in the studied 
      region, triggered by church bell ringing, varied between 0 and about 5.5 per night. 
      The results suggest that up to 120-150 m distance from churches, on average more 
      than one additional EEG awakening occurs per night per person. An estimated 2.5-3.5 
      percent of the population in the Canton of Zurich experiences at least one 
      additional awakening per night due to church bell noise. To provide a simple 
      decision support tool for authorities that consider limiting bell ringing in the 
      night in some form, we simulated different scenarios to estimate the effects of 
      different sound attenuation measures at the belfry as well as the effects of 
      different lengths and positions of nocturnal bell ringing suspension periods. The 
      number of awakenings could be reduced by more than 99 percent by, for example, 
      suspending church bell ringing between midnight and 06 h in the morning. A reduction 
      of the number of AWRs of about 75 percent could be achieved by reducing the 
      sound-pressure levels of bells by 5 dB.

TI  - Efficacy of Chloral Hydrate and Promethazine for Sedation during 
      Electroencephalography in Children; a Randomised Clinical Trial.
PG  - 27-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare efficacy and safety of oral 
      chloral hydrate (CH) and promethazine (PZ) for sedation during 
      electroencephalography (EEG) in children. METHODS: In a parallel single-blinded 
      randomized clinical trial, sixty 1-10 year old children referred to EEG Unit of 
      Shahid Sadoughi Hospital from January 2010 to February 2011 in Yazd, Iran, were 
      evaluated. They were randomized to receive orally 70 mg/kg chloral hydrate or 
      promethazine 1 mg/kg. The primary outcome was efficacy in adequate sedation and 
      successful recording of EEG. Secondary outcome included clinical side effects, time 
      from administration of the drug to adequate sedation, caregiver's satisfaction on a 
      Likert scale, and total stay time in EEG Unit. FINDINGS: Twenty four cases with mean 
      age 2.9±1.9 years were evaluated. Adequate sedation (Ramsay sedation score of four) 
      was obtained in 43.3% of PZ and 100% of CH group (P=0.00001). Also in 70% of PZ and 
      96.7% of CH group, EEG was successfully recorded (P=0.006). So, CH was a more 
      effective drug. In CH group, EEG was performed in shorter time after taking the drug 
      (32.82±9.6 vs 52.14±22.88 minutes, P<0.001) and the parents waited less in the EEG 
      unit (1.29±0.54 vs 2.6±0.59 hours, P<0.001). They were also more satisfied (4.6±0.6 
      scores vs 3.1±1.4 scores, P=0.001). Mild side effects such as vomiting in 20% of CH 
      (n = 6) and agitation in 6.6% of PZ group (n = 2) were seen. No significant 
      difference was seen from viewpoint of side effects frequency between the two drugs. 
      CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed that chloral hydrate can be 
      considered as a safe and more effective drug in sedation induction for sleep EEG in 
      children.

TI  - On the Individuality of Sleep EEG Spectra.
PG  - 105-112
AB  - Research in recent years has supported the hypothesis that many properties of the 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) are specific to an individual. In this study, the intra- 
      and inter-individual variations of sleep EEG signals were investigated. This was 
      carried out by analyzing the stability of the average EEG spectra individually 
      computed for the Rechtschaffen and Kales (RK) sleep stages. Six EEG channels were 
      used to account for the topographical aspect of the analysis. Validity of the 
      results was supported by considering a wide dataset of 174 subjects with normal 
      sleep. Subjects spent two consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory during which 
      EEG recordings were obtained. High similarity between average spectra of two 
      consecutive nights was found considering an individual. More than 89% of the second 
      night recordings were correctly assigned to their counterparts of the first night. 
      The average spectra of sleep EEG computed for each RK sleep stage have shown a high 
      degree of individuality.

TI  - Patient machine interface for the control of mechanical ventilation devices.
PG  - 1554-68
LID - 10.3390/brainsci3041554 [doi]
AB  - The potential of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to translate brain activity into 
      commands to control external devices during mechanical ventilation (MV) remains 
      largely unexplored. This is surprising since the amount of patients that might 
      benefit from such assistance is considerably larger than the number of patients 
      requiring BCI for motor control. Given the transient nature of MV (i.e., used mainly 
      over night or during acute clinical conditions), precluding the use of invasive 
      methods, and inspired by current research on BCIs, we argue that scalp recorded EEG 
      (electroencephalography) signals can provide a non-invasive direct communication 
      pathway between the brain and the ventilator. In this paper we propose a Patient 
      Ventilator Interface (PVI) to control a ventilator during variable conscious states 
      (i.e., wake, sleep, etc.). After a brief introduction on the neural control of 
      breathing and the clinical conditions requiring the use of MV we discuss the 
      conventional techniques used during MV. The schema of the PVI is presented followed 
      by a description of the neural signals that can be used for the on-line control. To 
      illustrate the full approach, we present data from a healthy subject, where the 
      inspiration and expiration periods during voluntary breathing were discriminated 
      with a 92% accuracy (10-fold cross-validation) from the scalp EEG data. The paper 
      ends with a discussion on the advantages and obstacles that can be forecasted in 
      this novel application of the concept of BCI.

      in mice.

LID - 107
AB  - EEG gamma band oscillations have been proposed to account for the neural 
      synchronization crucial for perceptual integration. While increased gamma power and 
      synchronization is generally observed during cognitive tasks performed during wake, 
      several studies have additionally reported increased gamma power during sleep or 
      anesthesia, raising questions about the characteristics of gamma oscillation during 
      impaired consciousness and its role in conscious processing. Phase-amplitude 
      modulation has been observed between slow wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4 Hz) and gamma 
      oscillations during ketamine/xylazine anesthesia or sleep, showing increased gamma 
      activity corresponding to the depolarized (ON) state of SWA. Here we divided gamma 
      activity into its ON and OFF (hyperpolarized) state components based on the phase of 
      SWA induced by ketamine/xylazine anesthesia and compared their power and synchrony 
      with wake state levels in mice. We further investigated the state-dependent changes 
      in both gamma power and synchrony across primary motor and primary somatosensory 
      cortical regions and their interconnected thalamic regions throughout anesthesia and 
      recovery. As observed previously, gamma power was as high as during wake 
      specifically during the ON state of SWA. However, the synchrony of this gamma 
      activity between somatosensory-motor cortical regions was significantly reduced 
      compared to the baseline wake state. In addition, the somatosensory-motor cortical 
      synchrony of gamma oscillations was reduced and restored in an anesthetic 
      state-dependent manner, reflecting the changing depth of anesthesia. Our results 
      provide evidence that during anesthesia changes in long-range information 
      integration between cortical regions might be more critical for changes in 
      consciousness than changes in local gamma oscillatory power.

TI  - Development of Brain EEG Connectivity across Early Childhood: Does Sleep Play a 
      Role?
PG  - 1445-60
LID - 10.3390/brainsci3041445 [doi]
AB  - Sleep has beneficial effects on brain function and learning, which are reflected in 
      plastic changes in the cortex. Early childhood is a time of rapid maturation in 
      fundamental skills-e.g., language, cognitive control, working memory-that are 
      predictive of future functioning. Little is currently known about the interactions 
      between sleep and brain maturation during this developmental period. We propose 
      coherent electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during sleep may provide unique insight 
      into maturational processes of functional brain connectivity. Longitudinal sleep EEG 
      assessments were performed in eight healthy subjects at ages 2, 3 and 5 years. Sleep 
      EEG coherence increased across development in a region- and frequency-specific 
      manner. Moreover, although connectivity primarily decreased intra-hemispherically 
      across a night of sleep, an inter-hemispheric overnight increase occurred in the 
      frequency range of slow waves (0.8-2 Hz), theta (4.8-7.8 Hz) and sleep spindles 
      (10-14 Hz), with connectivity changes of up to 20% across a night of sleep. These 
      findings indicate sleep EEG coherence reflects processes of brain maturation-i.e., 
      programmed unfolding of neuronal networks-and moreover, sleep-related alterations of 
      brain connectivity during the sensitive maturational window of early childhood.

TI  - Steps toward developing an EEG biofeedback treatment for chronic pain.
PG  - 101-8
LID - 10.1007/s10484-013-9214-9 [doi]
AB  - Chronic pain, usually refractory to analgesics, is a significant problem for many 
      individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Preliminary studies suggest that 
      electroencephalography (EEG) biofeedback (also known as neurofeedback, NF) has the 
      potential to help patients with otherwise refractory chronic pain. However, there 
      remain many unanswered questions about the effects and mechanisms of this treatment. 
      We studied 13 individuals with SCI and chronic pain with NF. Ten of the 13 
      individuals completed 4 sessions each of three different neurofeedback protocols 
      assigned in random order for a total of 12 NF sessions. All three protocols had 
      similar immediate effects on pain intensity. In addition, the participants reported 
      modest pre- to post-treatment decreases in worst pain and pain unpleasantness 
      following completion of the 12 NF sessions. These improvements were maintained at 
      3-month follow-up. The majority of the participants felt they benefited from and 
      were satisfied with the treatment. No significant effects on measures of other 
      outcome domains (sleep quality, pain interference and fatigue) were observed, 
      although there was a non-significant trend for an increase in fatigue. Finally, pre- 
      to post-treatment changes in EEG bandwidth activity, consistent with the training 
      protocols, were observed in θ and α but not β frequencies. The findings provide 
      preliminary support for the potential efficacy of NF for the treatment of 
      SCI-related pain, and suggest that further clinical studies are warranted.

AB  - In the present study, the alteration in the sleep EEG in rats due to chronic 
      exposure to low-level non-thermal electromagnetic radiation was investigated. Two 
      types of radiation fields were used; 900 MHz unmodulated wave and 900 MHz modulated 
      at 8 and 16 Hz waves. Animals has exposed to radiation fields for 1 month (1 h/day). 
      EEG power spectral analyses of exposed and control animals during slow wave sleep 
      (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep) revealed that the REM sleep is more 
      susceptible to modulated radiofrequency radiation fields (RFR) than the SWS. The 
      latency of REM sleep increased due to radiation exposure indicating a change in the 
      ultradian rhythm of normal sleep cycles. The cumulative and irreversible effect of 
      radiation exposure was proposed and the interaction of the extremely low frequency 
      radiation with the similar EEG frequencies was suggested.

AB  - The occurrence of dynamic changes in spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms 
      in the awake state or sleep is highly variable. These rhythms can be externally 
      modulated during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with a perturbation method 
      to trigger oscillatory brain activity. EEG-TMS co-registration was performed during 
      standard wake, during wake after sleep deprivation and in sleep in six healthy 
      subjects. Dynamic changes in the regional neural oscillatory activity of the 
      cortical areas were characterized using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet 
      method, and the modulation of induced oscillations were related to different 
      vigilance states. A reciprocal synchronizing/desynchronizing effect on slow and fast 
      oscillatory activity was observed in response to focal TMS after sleep deprivation 
      and sleep. We observed a sleep-related slight desynchronization of alpha mainly over 
      the frontal areas, and a widespread increase in theta synchronization. These 
      findings could be interpreted as proof of the interference external brain 
      stimulation can exert on the cortex, and how this could be modulated by the 
      vigilance state. Potential clinical applications may include evaluation of 
      hyperexcitable states such as epilepsy or disturbed states of consciousness such as 
      minimal consciousness.

PG  - 106-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ebcr.2013.06.005 [doi]
AB  - Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) has been investigated 
      through EEG-fMRI with the aim of localizing the generators of the epileptic 
      activity, revealing, in most cases, the activation of the sensory-motor cortex 
      ipsilateral to the centrotemporal spikes (CTS). In this case report, we investigated 
      the brain circuits hemodynamically involved by CTS recorded during wakefulness and 
      sleep in one boy with CTS and a language disorder but without epilepsy. For this 
      purpose, the patient underwent EEG-fMRI coregistration. During the "awake session", 
      fMRI analysis of right-sided CTS showed increments of BOLD signal in the bilateral 
      sensory-motor cortex. During the "sleep session", BOLD increments related to 
      right-sided CTS were observed in a widespread bilateral cortical-subcortical network 
      involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, sensory-motor cortex, perisylvian cortex, and 
      cerebellum. In this patient, who fulfilled neither the diagnostic criteria for BECTS 
      nor that for electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES), the transition from 
      wakefulness to sleep was related to the involvement of a widespread 
      cortical-subcortical network related to CTS. In particular, the involvement of a 
      thalamic-perisylvian neural network similar to the one previously observed in 
      patients with ESES suggests a common sleep-related network dysfunction even in cases 
      with milder phenotypes without seizures. This finding, if confirmed in a larger 
      cohort of patients, could have relevant therapeutic implication.

TI  - [Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy is often misdiagnosed as sleep disorders in 
      children: a case series].
PG  - 257-67
AB  - INTRODUCTION. We present a series of children who underwent a video-polysomnographic 
      recording at our Sleep and Epilepsy Unit, who received a diagnosis of nocturnal 
      frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE). AIMS. To describe electroclinical and video 
      polygraphic features of paediatric NFLE that differentiate this condition from other 
      sleep disorders that overlap and mimic the sleep motor and autonomic events of NFLE. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS. The inclusion criterion was that the patients have their first 
      video-EEG-PSG recording in our laboratory. RESULTS. Twenty-four out of 190 children 
      were diagnosed with NFLE (group 1); while 166 had other sleep disorders (group 2). 
      Among children diagnosed with NFLE, seven were referred for sleep-disordered 
      breathing, seven for parasomnias, two for insomnia, two for hypersomnia, and one for 
      periodic limb movements, while five were referred for epilepsy. In group 1, 
      perinatal history was normal in most cases (21 out of 24) and a familiar history of 
      epilepsy was found in four cases. Sleep-disordered breathing was diagnosed as a 
      comorbid condition in four children. Standard EEG was normal in 21 cases. Interictal 
      EEG showed epileptic discharges in four cases, while ictal EEG was expressed by a 
      rhythmic theta activity preceded by an arousal and/or a short background 
      desynchronization, movement artifacts, and autonomic changes. All seizures, repeated 
      highly stereotyped motor events, were followed by stage shifts and/or a postural 
      change and, by short awakenings. CONCLUSIONS. We found a high percentage of children 
      with NFLE, often misdiagnosed or associated with other sleep disorders, which may be 
      a trigger for nocturnal seizures.

AB  - Objectives. To investigate the effect of Si Ni San freeze-dried powder (SNSP) on 
      sleep phase in insomniac and normal rats, to identify its mode of action in 
      improving sleep, and to provide a reliable method for determining pharmacodynamic 
      material basis of Si-Ni-San on improving sleep. Methods. Rats were deprived of sleep 
      by using the footplate electrical stimulator to record the rats' 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) by using polysomnography (PSG) 
      and copy insomnia model by the method of electric stimulation. Analysis on EEG and 
      EMG was carried out to observe the effects of SNSP on the sleep phase of insomniac 
      and normal rats. Results. Rats were treated by intragastric administration (i.g.) 
      consecutively for seven days. The results showed that the total sleep time was 
      extended; meanwhile, SWS2 (P < 0.01) and REMS (P < 0.05) were mainly prolonged for 
      both insomniac and normal rats. The dates implied SNSP could significantly improve 
      sleep. Conclusions. SNSP could prolong SWS2 and REMS, the experimental 
      reproducibility is good, and the dates indicate that SNSP has the sedative function. 
      Study on the effects of SNSP on sleep phases provided a basis for the further 
      studies on effective constituents and the pharmacodynamic mechanism of SNSP.

AB  - The use of information-based measures to assess changes in conscious state is an 
      increasingly popular topic. Though recent results have seemed to justify the merits 
      of such methods, little has been done to investigate the applicability of such 
      measures to children. For our work, we used the approximate entropy (ApEn), a 
      measure previously shown to correlate with changes in conscious state when applied 
      to the electroencephalogram (EEG), and sought to confirm whether previously reported 
      trends in adult ApEn values across wake and sleep were present in children. Besides 
      validating the prior findings that ApEn decreases from wake to sleep (including 
      wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep) in adults, we found that 
      previously reported ApEn decreases across vigilance states in adults were also 
      present in children (ApEn trends for both age groups: wake > REM sleep > non-REM 
      sleep). When comparing ApEn values between age groups, adults had significantly 
      larger ApEn values than children during wakefulness. After the application of an 8 
      Hz high-pass filter to the EEG signal, ApEn values were recalculated. The number of 
      electrodes with significant vigilance state effects dropped from all 109 electrodes 
      with the original 1 Hz filter to 1 electrode with the 8 Hz filter. The number of 
      electrodes with significant age effects dropped from 10 to 4. Our results support 
      the notion that ApEn can reliably distinguish between vigilance states, with 
      low-frequency sleep-related oscillations implicated as the driver of changes between 
      vigilance states. We suggest that the observed differences between adult and child 
      ApEn values during wake may reflect differences in connectivity between age groups, 
      a factor which may be important in the use of EEG to measure consciousness.

      of the bioactive constituents isolated from Cordyceps militaris/Cordyceps sinensis, 
      species of the fungal genus Cordyceps. It has traditionally been a prized Chinese 
      folk medicine for the human well-being. Because of similarity of chemical structure 
      of adenosine, cordycepin has been focused on the diverse effects of the central 
      nervous systems (CNSs), like sleep regulation. Therefore, this study was undertaken 
      to know whether cordycepin increases the natural sleep in rats, and its effect is 
      mediated by adenosine receptors (ARs). Sleep was recorded using electroencephalogram 
      (EEG) for 4 hours after oral administration of cordycepin in rats. Sleep 
      architecture and EEG power spectra were analyzed. Cordycepin reduced sleep-wake 
      cycles and increased nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Interestingly, cordycepin 
      increased θ (theta) waves power density during NREM sleep. In addition, the protein 
      levels of AR subtypes (A1, A2A, and A2B) were increased after the administration of 
      cordycepin, especially in the rat hypothalamus which plays an important role in 
      sleep regulation. Therefore, we suggest that cordycepin increases theta waves power 
      density during NREM sleep via nonspecific AR in rats. In addition, this experiment 
      can provide basic evidence that cordycepin may be helpful for sleep-disturbed 
      subjects.

TI  - The effect of EEG biofeedback on reducing postcancer cognitive impairment.
PG  - 475-87
LID - 10.1177/1534735413477192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES: Postcancer cognitive impairment (PCCI) is observed in a 
      substantial number of breast cancer survivors, persisting for as long as 20 years in 
      some subgroups. Although compensatory strategies are frequently suggested, no 
      restorative interventions have yet been identified. This study examined the 
      feasibility of EEG biofeedback ("neurofeedback") and its potential effectiveness in 
      reducing PCCI as well as the fatigue, sleep disturbance, and psychological symptoms 
      that frequently accompany PCCI. STUDY DESIGN: This was a 6-month prospective study 
      with a waitlist control period followed by an active intervention. Participants were 
      female breast cancer survivors (n = 23), 6 to 60 months postchemotherapy, with 
      self-reported cognitive impairment. METHODS: Four self-report outcome measures 
      (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function [FACT-Cog], Functional 
      Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue [FACIT-Fatigue], Pittsburgh Sleep 
      Quality Index [PSQI], and Brief Symptom Inventory [BSI]-18) were administered 3 
      times during a 10-week waitlist control period, 3 times during a 10-week 
      (20-session) neurofeedback training regimen, and once at 4 weeks postneurofeedback. 
      RESULTS: All 23 participants completed the study, demonstrating the feasibility of 
      EEG biofeedback in this population. Initially, the sample demonstrated significant 
      dysfunction on all measures compared with general population norms. 
      Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed strongly significant improvements (P < .001) on 
      all 4 cognitive measures (perceived cognitive impairment, comments from others, 
      perceived cognitive abilities, and impact on quality of life [QOL]), the fatigue 
      scale, and the 4 psychological scales (somatization, depression, anxiety and global 
      severity index) as well as on 3 of 8 sleep scales (quality, daytime dysfunction, and 
      global). Two of the other sleep scales (latency and disturbance) were significant at 
      P < .01, and 1 (use of medication) at P < .05; 2 were not significant. Improvements 
      were generally linear across the course of training, and were maintained at the 
      follow-up testing. At the follow-up testing, the sample no longer differed 
      significantly from normative populations on 3 of the 4 FACT-Cog measures 
      (impairment, impact on QOL, and comments), FACIT-Fatigue, PSQI sleep quality and 
      habitual efficiency, or any of the BSI-18 measures of psychological disturbance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Data from this limited study suggest that EEG biofeedback has potential 
      for reducing the negative cognitive and emotional sequelae of cancer treatment as 
      well as improving fatigue and sleep patterns.

AB  - Continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS) is an epileptic encephalopathy 
      characterized in most patients by (1) difficult to control seizures, (2) interictal 
      epileptiform activity that becomes prominent during sleep leading to an 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern of electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES), 
      and (3) neurocognitive regression. In this paper, we will summarize current 
      epidemiological, clinical, and EEG knowledge on CSWS and will provide suggestions 
      for treatment. CSWS typically presents with seizures around 2-4 years of age. 
      Neurocognitive regression occurs around 5-6 years of age, and it is accompanied by 
      subacute worsening of EEG abnormalities and seizures. At approximately 6-9 years of 
      age, there is a gradual resolution of seizures and EEG abnormalities, but the 
      neurocognitive deficits persist in most patients. The cause of CSWS is unknown, but 
      early developmental lesions play a major role in approximately half of the patients, 
      and genetic associations have recently been described. High-dose benzodiazepines and 
      corticosteroids have been successfully used to treat clinical and 
      electroencephalographic features. Corticosteroids are often reserved for refractory 
      disease because of adverse events. Valproate, ethosuximide, levetiracetam, 
      sulthiame, and lamotrigine have been also used with some success. Epilepsy surgery 
      may be considered in a few selected patients.

AB  - Dreaming-a particular form of consciousness that occurs during sleep-undergoes major 
      changes in the course of the night. We aimed to outline state-dependent features of 
      consciousness using a paradigm with multiple serial awakenings/questionings that 
      allowed for within as well as between subject comparisons. Seven healthy 
      participants who spent 44 experimental study nights in the laboratory were awakened 
      by a computerized sound at 15-30 min intervals, regardless of sleep stage, and 
      questioned for the presence or absence of sleep consciousness. Recall without 
      content ("I was experiencing something but do not remember what") was considered 
      separately. Subjects had to indicate the content of the most recent conscious 
      experience prior to the alarm sound and to estimate its duration and richness. We 
      also assessed the degree of thinking and perceiving, self- and 
      environment-relatedness and reflective consciousness of the experiences. Of the 778 
      questionings, 5% were performed during wakefulness, 2% in stage N1, 42% in N2, 33% 
      in N3, and 17% in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Recall with content was reported 
      in 34% of non-REM and in 77% of REM sleep awakenings. Sleep fragmentation inherent 
      to the study design appeared to only minimally affect the recall of conscious 
      experiences. Each stage displayed a unique combination of characteristic features of 
      sleep consciousness. In conclusion, our serial awakening paradigm allowed us to 
      collect a large and representative sample of conscious experiences across states of 
      being. It represents a time-efficient method for the study of sleep consciousness 
      that may prove particularly advantageous when combined with techniques such as 
      functional MRI and high-density EEG.

AB  - Low voltage-activated (LVA) T-type calcium channels are well regarded as a key 
      mechanism underlying the generation of neuronal burst-firing. Their low threshold 
      for activation combined with a rapid and transient calcium conductance generates 
      low-threshold calcium potentials (LTCPs), upon the crest of which high frequency 
      action potentials fire for a brief period. Experiments using simultaneous 
      electroencephalography (EEG) and intracellular recordings demonstrate that neuronal 
      burst-firing is a likely causative component in the generation of normal sleep 
      patterns as well as some pathophysiological conditions, such as epileptic seizures. 
      However, less is known as to how these neuronal bursts impact brain behavior, in 
      particular network synchronization. In this review we summarize recent findings 
      concerning the role of T-type calcium channels in burst-firing and discuss how they 
      likely contribute to the generation of network synchrony. We further outline the 
      function of burst-firing and network synchrony in terms of epileptic seizures. This 
      article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Calcium channels.

AB  - NREM sleep is characterized by K-complexes (KCs), over the negative phase of which 
      we identified brief activity in the theta range. We recorded high resolution EEG of 
      whole-night sleep from seven healthy volunteers and visually identified 2nd and 3rd 
      stage NREM spontaneous KCs. We identified three major categories: (1) KCs without 
      intra-KC-activity (iKCa), (2) KCs with non-oscillatory iKCa, and (3) KCs with 
      oscillatory iKCa. The latter group of KCs with intra-KC-oscillation (iKCo), was 
      clustered according to the duration of the iKCo. iKCa was observed in most KCs 
      (1150/1522, 75%). iKCos with 2, 3, and 4 waves were observed in 52% (786/1522) of 
      KCs in respective rates of 49% (386/786), 44%, and 7%. Successive waves of iKCos 
      showed on average a shift of their maximal amplitude in the anterio-posterior axis, 
      while the average amplitude of the slow KC showed no spatial shift in time. The iKCo 
      spatial shift was accompanied by transient increases in instantaneous frequency from 
      the theta band toward the alpha band, followed by decreases to upper theta. The 
      study shows that the KC is most often concurrently accompanied by an independent 
      brief iKCo exhibiting topographical relocation of amplitude maxima with every 
      consecutive peak and transient increases in frequency. The iKCo features are 
      potentially reflecting arousing processes taking place during the KC.

AB  - Our aim was to evaluate the EEG and clinical modifications induced by the new 
      antiepileptic drug lacosamide (LCM) in patients with epilepsy. We evaluated 10 
      patients affected by focal pharmacoresistant epilepsy in which LCM (mean 250 mg/day) 
      was added to the preexisting antiepileptic therapy, which was left unmodified. 
      Morning waking EEG recording was performed before (t0) and at 6 months (t1) after 
      starting LCM. At t0 and t1, patients were also administered questionnaires 
      evaluating mood, anxiety, sleep, sleepiness, and fatigue (Beck Depression Inventory; 
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Y1 and Y2; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; Epworth 
      Sleepiness Scale; Fatigue Severity Scale). We performed a quantitative analysis of 
      EEG interictal abnormalities and background EEG power spectrum analysis. LCM as an 
      add-on did not significantly affect anxiety, depression, sleepiness, sleep quality, 
      and fatigue scales. Similarly, adding LCM to preexisting therapy did not modify 
      significantly patient EEGs in terms of absolute power, relative power, mean 
      frequency, and interictal abnormalities occurrence. In conclusion, in this small 
      cohort of patients, we confirmed that LCM as an add-on does not affect subjective 
      parameters which play a role, among others, in therapy tolerability, and our 
      clinical impression was further supported by evaluation of EEG spectral analysis.

AB  - EEG after sleep deprivation (SD-EEG) is widely used in many epilepsy centers as an 
      important tool in the epilepsy diagnosis process. However, after more than 40 years 
      of use, there are a number of issues which still need to be clarified concerning its 
      features and role. In particular, the many scientific papers addressing its role in 
      epilepsy diagnosis often differ remarkably from each other in terms of the type of 
      patients assessed, their description and study design. Furthermore, also the length 
      and the type of EEG performed after SD, as well as the length of SD itself, vary 
      dramatically from one study to another. In this paper we shortly underscore the 
      abovementioned differences among the different reports, as well as some 
      interpretations of the findings obtained in the different studies. This analysis 
      emphasizes, if needed, how SD-EEG still represents a crucial step in epilepsy 
      diagnosis, and how additional, controlled studies might further shape its precise 
      diagnostic/prognostic role.

AB  - The central nervous system is the most likely target of mobile telephony 
      radiofrequency (RF) field exposure in terms of biological effects. Several 
      electroencephalography (EEG) studies have reported variations in the alpha-band 
      power spectrum during and/or after RF exposure, in resting EEG and during sleep. In 
      this context, the observation of the spontaneous electrical activity of neuronal 
      networks under RF exposure can be an efficient tool to detect the occurrence of 
      low-level RF effects on the nervous system. Our research group has developed a 
      dedicated experimental setup in the GHz range for the simultaneous exposure of 
      neuronal networks and monitoring of electrical activity. A transverse 
      electromagnetic (TEM) cell was used to expose the neuronal networks to GSM-1800 
      signals at a SAR level of 3.2 W/kg. Recording of the neuronal electrical activity 
      and detection of the extracellular spikes and bursts under exposure were performed 
      using microelectrode arrays (MEAs). This work provides the proof of feasibility and 
      preliminary results of the integrated investigation regarding exposure setup, 
      culture of the neuronal network, recording of the electrical activity, and analysis 
      of the signals obtained under RF exposure. In this pilot study on 16 cultures, there 
      was a 30% reversible decrease in firing rate (FR) and bursting rate (BR) during a 3 
      min exposure to RF. Additional experiments are needed to further characterize this 
      effect.

AB  - Human deep sleep is characterized by reduced sensory activity, responsiveness to 
      stimuli, and conscious awareness. Given its ubiquity and reversible nature, it 
      represents an attractive paradigm to study the neural changes which accompany the 
      loss of consciousness in humans. In particular, the deepest stages of sleep can 
      serve as an empirical test for the predictions of theoretical models relating the 
      phenomenology of consciousness with underlying neural activity. A relatively recent 
      shift of attention from the analysis of evoked responses toward spontaneous (or 
      "resting state") activity has taken place in the neuroimaging community, together 
      with the development of tools suitable to study distributed functional interactions. 
      In this review we focus on recent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) 
      studies of spontaneous activity during sleep and their relationship with theoretical 
      models for human consciousness generation, considering the global workspace theory, 
      the information integration theory, and the dynamical core hypothesis. We discuss 
      the venues of research opened by these results, emphasizing the need to extend the 
      analytic methodology in order to obtain a dynamical picture of how functional 
      interactions change over time and how their evolution is modulated during different 
      conscious states. Finally, we discuss the need to experimentally establish absent or 
      reduced conscious content, even when studying the deepest sleep stages.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that compound 1 displayed high affinity towards 
      histamine H3 receptor (H3R), (human (h-H3R), K(i)=8.6 nM, rhesus monkey (rh-H3R), 
      K(i)=1.2 nM, and rat (r-H3R), K(i)=16.5 nM), but exhibited high affinity for hERG 
      channel. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel, potent, and highly selective 
      H3R antagonist/inverse agonist 5a(SS) (SAR110068) with acceptable hERG channel 
      selectivity and desirable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties through 
      lead optimization sequence. The significant awakening effects of 5a(SS) on 
      sleep-wake cycles studied by using EEG recording in rats during their light phase 
      support its potential therapeutic utility in human sleep-wake disorders.

TI  - The tower of Babel: survey on concepts and terminology in electrical status 
      epilepticus in sleep and continuous spikes and waves during sleep in North America.
PG  - 741-50
LID - 10.1111/epi.12039 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The terms "electrical status epilepticus during sleep (ESES)" and 
      "continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS)" have been used interchangeably 
      when referring to related but different concepts. In addition, the quantification of 
      epileptiform activity has not been standardized, and different approaches to 
      quantification have been used. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to 
      which pediatric neurologists and epileptologists use a homogeneous terminology and 
      conceptualization in CSWS and ESES and to characterize the current understanding of 
      these conditions. METHODS: A survey addressing the use of terminology in "ESES" and 
      "CSWS" and the understanding of related concepts was distributed online to all 
      members of the Child Neurology Society and the American Epilepsy Society mailing 
      lists. Surveys were self-administered and collected using an online survey website 
      (http://www.surveymonkey.com). KEY FINDINGS:   Two hundred nineteen surveys were 
      completed, 137 from the Child Neurology Society mailing list and 82 from the 
      American Epilepsy Society mailing list. ESES and CSWS were considered synonymous by 
      117 respondents, not synonymous by 61, 21 respondents did not know, and 20 did not 
      respond. Most respondents (63.1%) considered CSWS as a devastating epileptic 
      encephalopathy with severe sequelae even if treated correctly, but 25.1% of 
      respondents indicated that it does not leave sequelae if epilepsy was treated early 
      and another 11.8% noted that cognitive difficulties resolved with age. Cognitive 
      and/or language regression were considered mandatory for the diagnosis of CSWS by 
      only 27% of the respondents. The diagnosis of CSWS was based on 
      electroencephalography (EEG) assessment alone by 31% of respondents. Respondents 
      used different methods for calculation of the epileptiform activity, different EEG 
      samples for calculation, and considered differently the lateralized epileptiform 
      activity. The cut-off values for percentage of the sleep record occupied by 
      spike-waves were variable depending on the respondent. There was no agreement on 
      whether these cutoff values were mandatory for the diagnosis of ESES and CSWS. 
      SIGNIFICANCE:   Our data show that the professionals caring for children with ESES 
      and CSWS in North America use the terms, concepts, and defining features 
      heterogeneously. The lack of a common language may complicate communication among 
      clinicians and jeopardize research in this field. We anticipate that our data will 
      fuel the development of much needed common terminology and conceptualization of ESES 
      and CSWS.

      technologies was associated with low HPSG failure rate. METHODS: Patients referred 
      by chest physicians for clinical suspicion of OSA underwent one HPSG, using Dream® 
      and Sleepbox® (Medatec, Belgium), which is a wireless system able to communicate 
      with Dream®, and with Internet through a wi-fi/3G interface. It is equipped with a 
      digital infrared camera, and with a speaker/microphone system for bidirectional 
      audio/video communication via Skype®. The Sleep Lab nurse performed a remote 
      discontinuous monitoring of the PSG. In case of sensor loss, she called the patient 
      who had been previously educated to replace the sensors. RESULTS: Twenty-one 
      patients have been studied. 90% of the recordings were of excellent quality. We 
      observed a 10% PSG failure rate: one failure of the Dream®, and one recording of 
      poor quality. There were 2 successful Skype® interventions resulting in readjustment 
      of the defective probes (nasal cannula and EEG). PSG signal visualization was 
      possible in 90% of cases but Skype® connection was problematic in 19% of cases. 
      However, patients could be reached by phone to solve the problem. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Real-time attended HPSG through telematic data transmission is feasible and could be 
      an interesting perspective to decrease the failure rate of home sleep studies, even 
      if some technical aspects need to be improved.

PG  - 779-89
LID - 10.1177/0269881113492899 [doi]
AB  - Previous research in ecstasy users suggests impairment of various executive 
      functions. In general, the executive function of response inhibition appears 
      unaffected by ecstasy use. Nonetheless, it remains a possibility that cognitive 
      tasks alone are not sensitive enough to pick up subtle changes in function. The 
      current study sought to investigate behavioural measures of response inhibition and 
      their electrophysiological correlates in drug users. Twenty ecstasy polydrug users, 
      20 non-ecstasy polydrug users and 20 drug naïve controls were recruited. 
      Participants completed questionnaires about their background drug use, sleep 
      quality, fluid intelligence and mood state. Each individual also completed a Go/NoGo 
      response inhibition task whilst electroencephalography (EEG) measures were recorded. 
      Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that there were no between-group differences 
      on the behavioural measure of response inhibition. Multivariate analysis of variance 
      (MANOVA) revealed no main effect of group across midline electrodes for the P3, N2 
      and P2 components. Univariate ANOVA revealed significant between-group differences 
      in the P2 component with the ecstasy user group having a significantly higher mean 
      amplitude than drug naïve controls at two midline frontal electrodes: at Fz and 
      significantly higher mean amplitude than both control groups at FCz. The present 
      study provides evidence of atypical early processing in ecstasy users that is 
      suggestive of compensatory mechanisms ameliorating any behavioural differences.

TI  - Overnight Sleep Enhances Hippocampus-Dependent Aspects of Spatial Memory.
PG  - 1051-1057
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Several studies have now demonstrated that spatial information is 
      processed during sleep, and that posttraining sleep is beneficial for human 
      navigation. However, it remains unclear whether the effects of sleep are primarily 
      due to consolidation of cognitive maps, or alternatively, whether sleep might also 
      affect nonhippocampal aspects of navigation (e.g., speed of motion) involved in 
      moving through a virtual environment. DESIGN: Participants were trained on a virtual 
      maze navigation task (VMT) and then given a memory test following either a day of 
      wakefulness or a night of sleep. Subjects reported to the laboratory for training at 
      either 10:00am or 10:00pm, depending on randomly assigned condition, and were tested 
      11 h later. Overnight subjects slept in the laboratory with polysomnography. 
      SETTING: A hospital-based academic sleep laboratory. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: 
      Thirty healthy college student volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      RESULTS: Point-by-point position data were collected from the VMT. Analysis of the 
      movement data revealed a sleep-dependent improvement in maze completion time (P < 
      0.001) due to improved spatial understanding of the maze layout, which led to a 
      shortening of path from start to finish (P = 0.01) rather than faster exploration 
      speed through the maze (P = 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: We found that overnight sleep 
      benefitted performance, not because subjects moved faster through the maze, but 
      because they were more accurate in navigating to the goal. These findings suggest 
      that sleep enhances participants' knowledge of the spatial layout of the maze, 
      contributing to the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent spatial information.

PG  - 606385

LID - 606385
AB  - Frontal lobe seizures have a tendency to occur in sleep and in most cases occur 
      exclusively in sleep; these individuals are said to have nocturnal frontal lobe 
      (NFLE). NFLE can be difficult to distinguish clinically from various other sleep 
      disorders, particularly parasomnias, which also present with paroxysmal motor 
      activity in sleep. Interictal and ictal EEG findings are frequently unremarkable or 
      nonspecific in both parasomnias and NFLE making the diagnosis even more difficult. 
      Nocturnal epilepsy should be suspected in patients with paroxysmal events at night 
      characterized by high frequency, repetition, extrapyramidal features, and marked 
      stereotypy of attacks. Here we present a 13-year-old female who was extensively 
      worked up for choking episodes at night. On repeat video EEG she was found to have 
      frontal opercular seizures. Once on Carbamazepine, her seizures completely resolved.

TI  - [Nocturnal choking sensation].
PG  - A6204
AB  - There are many different types of sleep disorders. The majority of sleep-related 
      breathing disorders can be attributed to sleep apnoea syndrome. Nocturnal choking 
      sensation is a different symptom, for which we present two cases. Nocturnal choking 
      sensation is a terrifying symptom for the patient and the diagnostic approach can be 
      challenging. Aside from sleep choking syndrome, this symptom may appear with 
      nocturnal laryngospasm, insular epilepsy and nocturnal gastro-oesophageal reflux. A 
      thorough patient history and observation of the nocturnal event, sometimes supported 
      by EEG findings, may provide the clue to the diagnosis. These kinds of nocturnal 
      symptoms are best analyzed in a clinic specialized in both epilepsy and sleep 
      disorders.

LID - 932790
AB  - Since the formal characterization of sleep stages, there have been reports that 
      seizures may preferentially occur in certain phases of sleep. Through ascending 
      cholinergic connections from the brainstem, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is 
      physiologically characterized by low voltage fast activity on the 
      electroencephalogram, REMs, and muscle atonia. Multiple independent studies confirm 
      that, in REM sleep, there is a strikingly low proportion of seizures (~1% or less). 
      We review a total of 42 distinct conventional and intracranial studies in the 
      literature which comprised a net of 1458 patients. Indexed to duration, we found 
      that REM sleep was the most protective stage of sleep against focal seizures, 
      generalized seizures, focal interictal discharges, and two particular epilepsy 
      syndromes. REM sleep had an additional protective effect compared to wakefulness 
      with an average 7.83 times fewer focal seizures, 3.25 times fewer generalized 
      seizures, and 1.11 times fewer focal interictal discharges. In further studies REM 
      sleep has also demonstrated utility in localizing epileptogenic foci with potential 
      translation into postsurgical seizure freedom. Based on emerging connectivity data 
      in sleep, we hypothesize that the influence of REM sleep on seizures is due to a 
      desynchronized EEG pattern which reflects important connectivity differences unique 
      to this sleep stage.

AB  - The orexin (or hypocretin) system has been identified as a novel target for the 
      treatment of insomnia due to the wealth of biological and genetic data discovered 
      over the past decade. Recently, clinical proof-of-concept was achieved for the 
      treatment of primary insomnia using dual (OX1R/OX2R) orexin receptor antagonists. 
      However, elucidation of the pharmacology associated with selective orexin-2 receptor 
      antagonists (2-SORAs) has been hampered by the lack of orally bioavailable, highly 
      selective small molecule probes. Herein, the discovery and optimization of a novel 
      series of 2,5-diarylnicotinamides as potent and orally bioavailable orexin-2 
      receptor selective antagonists is described. A compound from this series 
      demonstrated potent sleep promotion when dosed orally to EEG telemetrized rats.

TI  - Identifying periods of drowsy driving using EEG.
PG  - 99-108
AB  - Drowsy driving is a significant contributor to death and injury crashes on our 
      nation's highways. Predictive neurophysiologic/physiologic solutions to reduce these 
      incidences have been proposed and developed. EEG based metrics were found to be 
      promising in initial studies, but remain controversial in their efficacy, primarily 
      due to failures to develop replication studies within the simulation settings used 
      for development, and real-world validation. This analysis sought to address these 
      short comings by assessing the utility of the B-Alert algorithms, in a replication 
      study of driving and drowsiness. Data were collected on the National Advanced 
      Driving Simulator from 72 volunteer drivers exposed to three types of roadways at 
      three times of day representing different levels of drowsiness. EEG metrics, 
      collected using the B-Alert X10 Wireless Headset were evaluated to determine their 
      utility in future predictive studies. The replication of the B-Alert algorithms was 
      a secondary focus for this analysis, resulting in highly variable start times within 
      each time of day segment, leading to EEG data being confounded by the diurnal 
      variations that occur in the basal EEG signal. Regardless of this limitation, the 
      analysis revealed promising outcomes. The EEG based algorithms for sleep onset, 
      drowsiness, as well as fatigue related power spectral bandwidths (i.e. lateral 
      central, and parietal alpha) varied with time of day of the drives. Interestingly, 
      EEG metrics of cognitive workload were also sensative to the terrain of the drives. 
      The replicaiton of the B-Alert algorithms were a secondary focuse in the study 
      design, Taken together, these data indicate great potential of carefully designed 
      studies to utilize neurophysiologic metrics to identify time of day and task and 
      road conditions that may be at greatest risk during fatigued/drowsy periods.

AB  - Our brain activity demonstrates amazing stability across multiple time frames 
      ranging from a few milliseconds to several hours. The longer cycles are commonly 
      called ultradian rhythms and they correspond to infralow frequencies (ILFs) in the 
      milli-Hz range (0.001 Hz). Ultradian rhythms between 90 minutes and 2 hours or 
      longer are readily observed in our electroencephalogram, and they reflect periods of 
      activity and rest, cycles of cortical excitability and plasticity followed by 
      relative inactivity. Our nightly sleep is organized into similar stages (rapid eye 
      movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep) as is our daily behavior (ie, the basic 
      rest-activity cycle). Astrocytes often exhibit milli-Hz ILFs, and they play a major 
      role in shaping neuronal plasticity and activity, and thus may organize or influence 
      the basic rhythms of sleep and waking. The nature and importance of astrocytes in 
      human brain functioning is subsequently reviewed.

AB  - EEG rhythms reflect the synchronized activity of underlying biological neuronal 
      network oscillations, and certain predominant frequencies are typically linked to 
      certain behavioral states. For instance, slow wave activity characterized by sleep 
      slow oscillation (SO) emerges normally during slow-wave sleep (SWS). In this 
      mini-review we will first give a background leading up to the present day 
      association between specific oscillations and their functional relevance for 
      learning and memory consolidation. Following, some principles on oscillatory 
      activity are summarized and finally results of studies employing slowly oscillating 
      transcranial electric stimulation are given. We underscore that oscillatory 
      transcranial electric stimulation presents a tool to study principles of cortical 
      network function.

AB  - Fatal insomnia (FI) is the first diagnosis to be considered by most neurologists 
      when approaching a patient presenting with total insomnia followed by personality 
      and cognitive changes, disturbance of alertness, autonomic hyperactivation and 
      movement abnormalities. We report the case of a 30 year-old male patient who 
      presented with total insomnia followed by episodes of psychomotor restlessness 
      resembling anxiety attacks. Twenty days later, he developed refractory convulsive 
      status epilepticus with admission to Intensive Care Unit. He progressed to a state 
      of reduced alertness and responsiveness, presenting periods of agitation with 
      abnormal dyskinetic movements, periods of autonomic instability and central 
      hypoventilation. Workup revealed antibodies against N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 
      (NMDAR). Immunotherapy treatment led to a very significant improvement with the 
      patient presenting only slight frontal lobe dysfunction after one year of recovery. 
      To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a patient with anti-NMDAR 
      encephalitis first presenting with total insomnia. Our aim is to alert that 
      anti-NMDAR encephalitis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of FI, 
      especially in sporadic cases. Distinguishing the two conditions is very important 
      as, contrarily to the fatal disclosure of FI, anti-NMDAR encephalitis is potentially 
      reversible with adequate treatment even after severe and prolonged disease.

      requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. A video EEG was performed which 
      demonstrated normal awake background without any seizure activity. Neurally adjusted

      diaphragm (Edi) when the patient was in quiet phase of sleep. This finding on NAVA 
      monitor raised the suspicion of central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) which was 
      confirmed by genetic identification of the PHOX2B mutation.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder of repetitive sleep disruption caused by 
      reduced or blocked respiratory airflow. Although an anatomically compromised airway 
      accounts for the major predisposition to OSA, a patient's arousal threshold and 
      factors related to the central control of breathing (ventilatory control stability) 
      are also important. Arousal from sleep (defined by EEG desynchronization) may be the 
      only mechanism that allows airway re-opening following an obstructive event. 
      However, in many cases arousal is unnecessary and even worsens the severity of OSA. 
      Mechanisms for arousal are poorly understood. However, accumulating data are 
      elucidating the relevant neural pathways and neurotransmitters. For example, 
      serotonin is critically required, but its site of action is unknown. Important 
      neural substrates for arousal have been recently identified in the parabrachial 
      complex (PB), a visceral sensory nucleus in the rostral pons. Moreover, 
      glutamatergic signaling from the PB contributes to arousal caused by hypercapnia, 
      one of the arousal-promoting stimuli in OSA. A major current focus of OSA research 
      is to find means to maintain airway patency during sleep, without sleep 
      interruption.

TI  - Increased cortical and thalamic excitability in freely moving APPswe/PS1dE9 mice 
      modeling epileptic activity associated with Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice modeling Alzheimer's disease display 
      frequent occurrence of seizures peaking at an age when amyloid plaques start to form 
      in the cortex and hippocampus. We tested the hypothesis that numerous reported 
      interactions of amyloid-β with cell surface molecules result in altered 
      excitation-inhibition balance in brain-wide neural networks, eventually leading to 
      epileptogenesis. We examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) and auditory-evoked 
      potentials (AEPs) in freely moving 4-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APdE9) and wild-type 
      (WT) control mice in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus during movement, 
      quiet waking, non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. 
      Cortical EEG power was higher in APdE9 mice than in WT mice over a broad frequency 
      range (5-100 Hz) and during all 4 behavioral states. Thalamic EEG power was also 
      increased but in a narrower range (10-80 Hz). Furthermore, APdE9 mice displayed 
      augmented cortical and thalamic AEPs. While power and theta-gamma modulation were 
      preserved in the APdE9 hippocampus, REM sleep-related phase shift of theta-gamma 
      modulation was altered. Our data suggest that at the early stage of amyloid 
      pathology, cortical principal cells become hyperexcitable and via extensive 
      cortico-thalamic connection drive thalamic cells. Minor hippocampal changes are most 
      likely secondary to abnormal entorhinal input.

TI  - Central sleep apnea and complex sleep apnea in patients with epilepsy.
PG  - 119-24
LID - 10.1007/s11325-013-0858-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to examine the prevalence of central sleep apnea (CSA) and 
      complex sleep apnea (CompSA) in patients with epilepsy and to examine their clinical 
      profile, with respect to epilepsy type, etiology, medication use, and EEG 
      abnormalities. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective analysis of 719 consecutive 
      patients with epilepsy who underwent polysomnography (PSG) at our institution 
      between 2004 and 2011. Of the 458 patients with complete data, we excluded 42 
      patients with congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction <40 %. 
      Comparison of clinical and PSG variables between the three groups were conducted 
      with Fisher exact test and analysis of variance. RESULTS: Out of 416 patients 
      tested, 315 (75 %) had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), 16 (3.7 %) had CSA, 33 (7.9 %) 
      had CompSA. There were more males in the CSA and CompSA groups than in the OSA group 
      (81.2, 81.8, and 59.6 %, respectively, p=0.04). Focal seizures were more prevalent 
      in patients with CSA than in patients OSA or CompSA (62.5, 265, and 21.1 %, 
      respectively, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: About 11 % of epilepsy patients have 
      sleep-breathing disorders with central apneas, which is not higher than that in a 
      general population. These data should be expanded with future research investigating 
      the role of interictal, ictal, and postictal central apneas in epileptogenesis and 
      epilepsy.

TI  - Are there sleep-specific phenotypes in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome? A 
      cross-sectional polysomnography analysis.

LID - e002999
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite sleep disturbances being a central complaint in patients with 
      chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), evidence of objective sleep abnormalities from over 
      30 studies is inconsistent. The present study aimed to identify whether 
      sleep-specific phenotypes exist in CFS and explore objective characteristics that 
      could differentiate phenotypes, while also being relevant to routine clinical 
      practice. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, single-site study. SETTING: A fatigue clinic in 
      the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive series of 343 patients meeting the 
      criteria for CFS, according to the Fukuda definition. MEASURES: Patients underwent a 
      single night of polysomnography (all-night recording of EEG, electromyography, 
      electrooculography, ECG and respiration) that was hand-scored by a researcher blind 
      to diagnosis and patient history. RESULTS: Of the 343 patients, 104 (30.3%) were 
      identified with a Primary Sleep Disorder explaining their diagnosis. A hierarchical 
      cluster analysis on the remaining 239 patients resulted in four sleep phenotypes 
      being identified at saturation. Of the 239 patients, 89.1% met quantitative criteria 
      for at least one objective sleep problem. A one-way analysis of variance confirmed 
      distinct sleep profiles for each sleep phenotype. Relatively longer sleep onset 
      latencies, longer Rapid Eye Movement (REM) latencies and smaller percentages of both 
      stage 2 and REM characterised the first phenotype. The second phenotype was 
      characterised by more frequent arousals per hour. The third phenotype was 
      characterised by a longer Total Sleep Time, shorter REM Latencies, and a higher 
      percentage of REM and lower percentage of wake time. The final phenotype had the 
      shortest Total Sleep Time and the highest percentage of wake time and wake after 
      sleep onset. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the need to routinely screen for 
      Primary Sleep Disorders in clinical practice and tailor sleep interventions, based 
      on phenotype, to patients presenting with CFS. The results are discussed in terms of 
      matching patients' self-reported sleep to these phenotypes in clinical practice.

AB  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a clinical condition 
      characterized by an intermittent or complete loss of muscle atonia and an increase 
      of phasic muscular activity during REM sleep (or Stage R), leading to complex 
      nocturnal motor behaviors. Correct and early diagnosis is important because RBD may 
      lead to serious injuries and is a well-treatable disorder. Since the characteristic 
      electrophysiologic finding in patients with RBD is the increased electromyographic 
      tone during REM sleep/Stage R, simultaneous video/polysomnography recording is 
      essential for diagnosing this parasomnia. Moreover, several neurophysiological 
      techniques have been used to improve our knowledge and understanding of this 
      troubling sleep disorder. We reviewed the most important studies employing 
      quantitative electroencephalography, event-related potentials, transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation, brainstem reflexes and cortico-muscular coherence analysis. All these 
      neurophysiological techniques have proven to provide a valuable tool to gain insight 
      into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying RBD. The review concludes with a 
      brief discussion on the possible future implications for improving therapeutic 
      approaches.

AB  - The perifornical area in the posterior lateral hypothalamus (PeFLH) has been 
      implicated in several physiological functions including the sleep-wakefulness 
      regulation. The PeFLH area contains several cell types including those expressing 
      orexins (Orx; also known as hypocretins), mainly located in the PeF nucleus. The aim 
      of the present study was to elucidate the synaptic interactions between Orx neurons 
      located in the PeFLH area and different brainstem neurons involved in the generation 
      of wakefulness and sleep stages such as the locus coeruleus (LC) nucleus 
      (contributing to wakefulness) and the oral pontine reticular nucleus (PnO) nucleus 
      (contributing to REM sleep). Anatomical data demonstrated the existence of a 
      neuronal network involving the PeFLH area, LC, and the PnO nuclei that would control 
      the sleep-wake cycle. Electrophysiological experiments indicated that PeFLH area had 
      an excitatory effect on LC neurons. PeFLH stimulation increased the firing rate of 
      LC neurons and induced an activation of the EEG. The excitatory effect evoked by 
      PeFLH stimulation in LC neurons was blocked by the injection of the Orx-1 receptor 
      antagonist SB-334867 into the LC. Similar electrical stimulation of the PeFLH area 
      evoked an inhibition of PnO neurons by activation of GABAergic receptors because the 
      effect was blocked by bicuculline application into the PnO. Our data also revealed 
      that the LC and PnO nuclei exerted a feedback control on neuronal activity of PeFLH 
      area. Electrical stimulation of LC facilitated firing activity of PeFLH neurons by 
      activation of catecholaminergic receptors whereas PnO stimulation inhibited PeFLH 
      neurons by activation of GABAergic receptors. In conclusion, Orx neurons of the 
      PeFLH area seem to be an important organizer of the wakefulness and sleep stages in 
      order to maintain a normal succession of stages during the sleep-wakefulness cycle.

TI  - Pathophysiology of epileptic encephalopathies.
PG  - 6-13
LID - 10.1111/epi.12417 [doi]
AB  - The application of metabolic imaging and genetic analysis, and now the development 
      of appropriate animal models, has generated critical insights into the pathogenesis 
      of epileptic encephalopathies. In this article we present ideas intended to move 
      from the lesions associated with epileptic encephalopathies toward understanding the 
      effects of these lesions on the functioning of the brain, specifically of the 
      cortex. We argue that the effects of focal lesions may be magnified through the 
      interaction between cortical and subcortical structures, and that disruption of 
      subcortical arousal centers that regulate cortex early in life may lead to 
      alterations of intracortical synapses that affect a critical period of cognitive 
      development. Impairment of interneuronal function globally through the action of a 
      genetic lesion similarly causes widespread cortical dysfunction manifesting as 
      increased delta slow waves on electroencephalography (EEG) and as developmental 
      delay or arrest clinically. Finally, prolonged focal epileptic activity during sleep 
      (as occurring in the syndrome of continuous spike-wave in slow sleep, or CSWSS) 
      might interfere with local slow wave activity at the site of the epileptic focus, 
      thereby impairing the neural processes and, possibly, the local plastic changes 
      associated with learning and other cognitive functions. Seizures may certainly add 
      to these pathologic processes, but they are likely not necessary for the development 
      of the cognitive pathology. Nevertheless, although seizures may be either a 
      consequence or symptom of the underlying lesion, their effective treatment can 
      improve outcomes as both clinical and experimental studies may suggest. 
      Understanding their substrates may lead to novel, effective treatments for all 
      aspects of the epileptic encephalopathy phenotype.

AB  - To many psychoanalysts dreams are a central source of knowledge of the 
      unconscious-the specific research object of psychoanalysis. The dialog with the 
      neurosciences, devoted to the testing of hypotheses on human behavior and 
      neurophysiology with objective methods, has added to psychoanalytic 
      conceptualizations on emotion, memory, sleep and dreams, conflict and trauma. To 
      psychoanalysts as well as neuroscientists, the neurological basis of psychic 
      functioning, particularly concerning trauma, is of special interest. In this 
      article, an attempt is made to bridge the gap between psychoanalytic findings and 
      neuroscientific findings on trauma. We then attempt to merge both approaches in one 
      experimental study devoted to the investigation of the neurophysiological changes 
      (fMRI) associated with psychoanalytic treatment in chronically depressed patients. 
      We also report on an attempt to quantify psychoanalysis-induced transformation in 
      the manifest content of dreams. To do so, we used two independent methods. First, 
      dreams reported during the cure of chronic depressed analysands were assessed by the 
      treating psychoanalyst. Second, dreams reported in an experimental context were 
      analyzed by an independent evaluator using a standardized method to quantify changes 
      in dream content (Moser method). Single cases are presented. Preliminary results 
      suggest that psychoanalysis-induced transformation can be assessed in an objective 
      way.

TI  - Detection of respiratory arousals using photoplethysmography (PPG) signal in sleep 
      apnea patients.
PG  - 1065-73
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2013.2282338 [doi]
AB  - Respiratory events during sleep induce cortical arousals and manifest changes in 
      autonomic markers in sleep disorder breathing (SDB). Finger photoplethysmography 
      (PPG) has been shown to be a reliable method of determining sympathetic activation. 
      We hypothesize that changes in PPG signals are sufficient to predict the occurrence 
      of respiratory-event-related cortical arousal. In this study, we develop a 
      respiratory arousal detection model in SDB subjects by using PPG features. PPG 
      signals from 10 SDB subjects (9 male, 1 female) with age range 43-75 years were used 
      in this study. Time domain features of PPG signals, such as 1) PWA--pulse wave 
      amplitude, 2) PPI--peak-to-peak interval, and 3) Area--area under peak, were used to 
      detect arousal events. In this study, PWA and Area have shown better performance 
      (higher accuracy and lower false rate) compared to PPI features. After investigating 
      possible groupings of these features, combination of PWA and Area (PWA + Area) was 
      shown to provide better accuracy with a lower false detection rate in arousal 
      detection. PPG-based arousal indexes agreed well across a wide range of decision 
      thresholds, resulting in a receiver operating characteristic with an area under the 
      curve of 0.91. For the decision threshold (PC(thresh) = 25%) chosen for the final 
      analyses, a sensitivity of 68.1% and a specificity of 95.2% were obtained. The 
      results showed an accuracy of 84.68%, 85.15%, 86.93%, and 50.79% with a false rate 
      of 21.80%, 55.41%, 64.78%, and 50.79% at PC(thresh) = 25% or PPI, PWA, Area , and 
      PWA + Area features, respectively. This indicates that combining PWA and Area 
      features reduced the false positive rate without much affecting the sensitivity of 
      the arousal detection system. In conclusion, the PPG-based respiratory arousal 
      detection model is a simple and promising alternative to the conventional 
      electroencephalogram (EEG)-based respiratory arousal detection system.

TI  - Clinical features and imaging findings in a case of Capgras syndrome.
PG  - 1095-9
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S47293 [doi]
AB  - Capgras syndrome consists of the delusional belief that a person or persons have 
      been replaced by doubles or impostors. It can occur in the context of both 
      psychiatric and organic illness, and seems to be related to lesions of the bifrontal 
      and right limbic and temporal regions. Indeed, magnetic resonance imaging has 
      revealed brain lesions in patients suffering from Capgras syndrome. This case study 
      reports the findings of a thorough diagnostic evaluation in a woman suffering from 
      Capgras syndrome and presenting with the following clinical peculiarities: obsessive 
      modality of presentation of the delusional ideation, intrusiveness of such ideation 
      (that even disturbed her sleep), as well as a sense of alienation and utter disgust 
      towards the double. These characteristics bring to mind the typical aspects of 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. Neuroanatomic investigation, through magnetic 
      resonance imaging, performed on this patient showed alteration of the bilateral 
      semioval centers, which are brain regions associated with the emotion of disgust and 
      often show alterations in subjects suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
      Hence, neuroimaging allows researchers to put forward the hypothesis of a common 
      neuroanatomic basis for Capgras syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, at least 
      for cases in which the delusional ideation is associated with deep feelings of 
      disgust and presents with a certain pervasiveness.

LID - 433
AB  - Sleep alterations are among the most important disabling manifestation symptoms of 
      Major Depression Disorder (MDD). A critical role of sleep importance is also 
      underlined by the fact that its adjustment has been proposed as an objective marker 
      of clinical remission in MDD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) 
      represents a relatively novel therapeutic tool for the treatment of drug-resistant 
      depression. Nevertheless, besides clinical evaluation of the mood improvement after 
      rTMS, we have no clear understanding of what are the neurophysiological correlates 
      of such treatment. One possible marker underlying the clinical outcome of rTMS in 
      MDD could be cortical changes on wakefulness and sleep activity. The aim of this 
      open-label study was to evaluate the efficacy of a sequential bilateral rTMS 
      treatment over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to improve the mood in MDD 
      patients, and to determine if rTMS can induce changes on the sleep structure, and if 
      those changes can be used as a surrogate marker of the clinical state of the 
      patient. Ten drug-resistant depressed patients participated to ten daily sessions of 
      sequential bilateral rTMS with a low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) over right-DLPFC and a 
      subsequent high-frequency (10 Hz) TMS over left-DLPFC. The clinical and 
      neurophysiological effects induced by rTMS were evaluated, respectively by means of 
      the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and by comparing the sleep pattern 
      modulations and the spatial changes of EEG frequency bands during both NREM and REM 
      sleep, before and after the real rTMS treatment. The sequential bilateral rTMS 
      treatment over the DLPFC induced topographical-specific decrease of the alpha 
      activity during REM sleep over left-DLPFC, which is significantly associated to the 
      clinical outcome. In line with the notion of a left frontal hypoactivation in MDD 
      patients, the observed local decrease of alpha activity after rTMS treatment during 
      the REM sleep suggests that alpha frequency reduction could be considered as a 
      marker of up-regulation of cortical activity induced by rTMS, as well as a surrogate 
      neurophysiological correlate of the clinical outcome.

PG  - 163-8
LID - 10.4103/0972-2327.112455 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We studied the phenotype and electroencephalographic (EEG) features, and 
      therapeutic aspects of idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs) in South Indian 
      population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional hospital-based 
      study was carried out on non-consecutive 287 patients (age 22.2 ± 7.7 years; M:F = 
      139:148) with IGE syndrome. Their clinical and EEG observations were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Majority of the patients had onset of seizures <20 years of age (n = 178; 
      62%). Thirty one patients (10.8%) had family history of epilepsy. Nearly half of 
      them (49.9%) had <5 years of duration of seizures. The type of IGEs included 
      Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME): 115 (40.1%); IGE with generalized tonic-clonic 
      seizures (GTCS) only: 102 (39.02%); childhood absence epilepsy (CAE): 35 (12.2%); 
      GTCS on awakening: 15 (5.2%); Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE): 11 (3.8%); and 
      unclassified seizures: 9 (3.1%). The triggering factors noted in 45% were sleep 
      deprivation (20%), non-compliance and stress in 5% each. The EEG (n = 280) showed 
      epileptiform discharges in about 50% of patients. Epileptiform discharges during 
      activation was observed in 40/249 patients (16.1%): Hyperventilation in 32 (12.8%) 
      and photic stimulation in 19 (7.6%). The seizures were well controlled with 
      anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in 232 (80.8%) patients and among them, 225 (78.4%) 
      patients were on monotherapy. Valproate (n = 131) was the most frequently prescribed 
      as monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest cohort of patients with IGE. 
      This study reiterates the importance of segregating IGE syndrome and such analysis 
      will aid to the current understanding and management.

AB  - Infantile spasms are a unique disorder of infancy and early childhood. The average 
      age at onset of infantile spasms is 6 months and the average incidence of the 
      disorder is approximately 0.31 per 1000 live births. Approximately one-quarter of 
      patients will spontaneously stop having spasms within 1 year of onset. There are 
      three main types of epileptic spasms: flexor, extensor, and mixed flexor-extensor. 
      Spasms frequently occur in clusters and commonly occur upon arousal from sleep. The 
      motor spasms are frequently confused with other normal and abnormal infant 
      behaviors. Typically, the interictal EEG reveals hypsarrhythmia or one of its 
      variants. A variety of ictal EEG patterns may be seen, the most common of which is a 
      generalized slow-wave transient followed by an attenuation of the background 
      activity in all regions. The primary treatment objective is to improve the EEG and 
      stop the spasms as soon as possible and to avoid prolonged treatment durations with 
      any form of therapy. Currently, there is no conclusive evidence that medical or 
      surgical treatment of infantile spasms significantly alters long-term outcome. 
      Although the pathophysiological mechanism underlying infantile spasms is unknown, 
      several animal models of infantile spasms have been developed in recent years.

TI  - Olfactory Hallucinations without Clinical Motor Activity: A Comparison of Unirhinal 
      with Birhinal Phantosmia.
PG  - 1483-553
LID - 10.3390/brainsci3041483 [doi]
AB  - Olfactory hallucinations without subsequent myoclonic activity have not been well 
      characterized or understood. Herein we describe, in a retrospective study, two major 
      forms of olfactory hallucinations labeled phantosmias: one, unirhinal, the other, 
      birhinal. To describe these disorders we performed several procedures to elucidate 
      similarities and differences between these processes. From 1272, patients evaluated 
      for taste and smell dysfunction at The Taste and Smell Clinic, Washington, DC with 
      clinical history, neurological and otolaryngological examinations, evaluations of 
      taste and smell function, EEG and neuroradiological studies 40 exhibited cyclic 
      unirhinal phantosmia (CUP) usually without hyposmia whereas 88 exhibited non-cyclic 
      birhinal phantosmia with associated symptomology (BPAS) with hyposmia. Patients with 
      CUP developed phantosmia spontaneously or after laughing, coughing or shouting 
      initially with spontaneous inhibition and subsequently with Valsalva maneuvers, 
      sleep or nasal water inhalation; they had frequent EEG changes usually ipsilateral 
      sharp waves. Patients with BPAS developed phantosmia secondary to several clinical 
      events usually after hyposmia onset with few EEG changes; their phantosmia could not 
      be initiated or inhibited by any physiological maneuver. CUP is uncommonly 
      encountered and represents a newly defined clinical syndrome. BPAS is commonly 
      encountered, has been observed previously but has not been clearly defined. 
      Mechanisms responsible for phantosmia in each group were related to decreased 
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity in specific brain regions. Treatment which 
      activated brain GABA inhibited phantosmia in both groups.

TI  - Efficacy of EMG- and EEG-Biofeedback in Fibromyalgia Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis and a 
      Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 962741

AB  - Objectives. Biofeedback (BFB) is an established intervention in the rehabilitation 
      of headache and other pain disorders. Little is known about this treatment option 
      for fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The aim of the present review is to integrate and 
      critically evaluate the evidence regarding the efficacy of biofeedback for FMS. 
      Methods. We conducted a literature search using Pubmed, clinicaltrials.gov (National 
      Institute of Health), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, 
      SCOPUS, and manual searches. The effect size estimates were calculated using a 
      random-effects model. Results. The literature search produced 123 unique citations. 
      One hundred sixteen records were excluded. The meta-analysis included seven studies 
      (321 patients) on EEG-Biofeedback and EMG-Biofeedback. In comparison to control 
      groups, biofeedback (BFB) significantly reduced pain intensity with a large effect 
      size (g = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.22-1.36). Subgroup analyses revealed that only EMG-BFB and 
      not EEG-BFB significantly reduced pain intensity in comparison to control groups (g 
      = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.11-1.62). BFB did not reduce sleep problems, depression, fatigue, 
      or health-related quality of life in comparison to a control group. Discussion. The 
      interpretation of the results is limited because of a lack of studies on the 
      long-term effects of EMG-BFB in FMS. Further research should focus on the long-term 
      efficacy of BFB in fibromyalgia and on the identification of predictors of treatment 
      response.

PG  - 611-2
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.2764 [doi]
AB  - We report on two sisters, 17 and 12 years of age, with clinical features suggesting 
      narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC): daytime sleepiness, spontaneous and emotionally 
      triggered sudden falls to the ground, and overweight/obesity. MSLT showed borderline 
      sleep latency, with 1 and 0 sleep onset REM periods. HLA typing disclosed the 
      DQB1*0602 allele. Video-polygraphy of the spells ruled out NC diagnosis by 
      demonstrating their easy elicitation by suggestion, with wake EEG, electromyographic 
      persistence of muscle tone, and stable presence of tendon reflexes (i.e., 
      pseudo-cataplexy), together with normal cerebrospinal hypocretin-1 levels. Our cases 
      emphasize the need of a clear depiction of cataplexy pattern at the different ages, 
      the usefulness of examining ictal neurophysiology, and collecting all available 
      disease markers in ambiguous cases.

TI  - Laugh-induced seizure: a case report.
PG  - 123
LID - 10.1186/1752-1947-7-123 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A laugh-induced seizure is an unrecognized condition and to the best 
      of our knowledge no case has been reported in the medical literature until now. We 
      present an interesting and extremely rare case in which laughing generated the 
      seizure activity that was recorded and confirmed by video electroencephalography. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old obese Caucasian man with history of bipolar 
      disorder and chronic headache presented with multiple episodes of seizures, all 
      induced by laughter while watching comedy shows. Each episode lasted approximately 
      five seconds. In each instance, he started laughing, then his arms started shaking 
      and he felt like 'his consciousness was being vacuumed away'. A physical examination 
      revealed normal findings. He had been maintained on valproic acid for bipolar 
      disorder and topiramate for his chronic headache, but this did not control his 
      symptoms. His sleep-deprived electroencephalography and brain magnetic resonance 
      imaging were normal except for an arachnoid cyst measuring 4.2 × 2.1cm in the 
      anterior right middle cranial fossa. His video electroencephalography demonstrated 
      laugh-induced seizure activities. He was then placed on carbamazepine. Following 
      treatment, he had two episodes of mild staring but no frank seizures, and his 
      seizures have remained well controlled on this regimen for more than a year. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Laugh-induced seizure is a most unusual clinical entity without any 
      previous case report. Confirmatory diagnosis can be made by video 
      electroencephalography recording of seizure activities provoked by laughing. As in 
      gelastic seizure without hypothalamic hamartoma, our case responded well to 
      polytherapy with topiramate and carbamazepine on top of laugh-provocation avoidance. 
      Further study is required to establish the standard treatment of this condition.

TI  - The Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire reveals multiple phenotypes of 
      resting-state cognition.

LID - 446
AB  - Resting-state neuroimaging is a dominant paradigm for studying brain function in 
      health and disease. It is attractive for clinical research because of its simplicity 
      for patients, straightforward standardization, and sensitivity to brain disorders. 
      Importantly, non-sensory experiences like mind wandering may arise from ongoing 
      brain activity. However, little is known about the link between ongoing brain 
      activity and cognition, as phenotypes of resting-state cognition-and tools to 
      quantify them-have been lacking. To facilitate rapid and structured measurements of 
      resting-state cognition we developed a 50-item self-report survey, the Amsterdam 
      Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ). Based on ARSQ data from 813 participants 
      assessed after 5 min eyes-closed rest in their home, we identified seven dimensions 
      of resting-state cognition using factor analysis: Discontinuity of Mind, Theory of 
      Mind, Self, Planning, Sleepiness, Comfort, and Somatic Awareness. Further, we showed 
      that the structure of cognition was similar during resting-state fMRI and EEG, and 
      that the test-retest correlations were remarkably high for all dimensions. To 
      explore whether inter-individual variation of resting-state cognition is related to 
      health status, we correlated ARSQ-derived factor scores with psychometric scales 
      measuring depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Mental health correlated 
      positively with Comfort and negatively with Discontinuity of Mind. Finally, we show 
      that sleepiness may partially explain a resting-state EEG profile previously 
      associated with Alzheimer's disease. These findings indicate that the ARSQ readily 
      provides information about cognitive phenotypes and that it is a promising tool for 
      research on the neural correlates of resting-state cognition in health and disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intellectual disability (ID) is often associated with behavioral 
      problems or disorders. Mutations in the GRIN2B gene (MRD6, MIM613970) have been 
      identified as a common cause of ID (prevalence of 0.5 - 1% in individuals with ID) 
      associated with EEG and behavioral problems. METHODS: We assessed five GRIN2B 
      mutation carriers aged between 3 and 14 years clinically and via standardized 
      questionnaires to delineate a detailed behavioral phenotype. Parents and teachers 
      rated problem behavior of their affected children by completing the Developmental 
      Behavior Checklist (DBC) and the Conners' Rating Scales Revised (CRS-R:L). RESULTS: 
      All individuals had mild to severe ID and needed guidance in daily routine. They 
      showed characteristic behavior problems with prominent hyperactivity, impulsivity, 
      distractibility and a short attention span. Stereotypies, sleeping problems and a 
      friendly but boundless social behavior were commonly reported. CONCLUSION: Our 
      observations provide an initial delineation of the behavioral phenotype of GRIN2B 
      mutation carriers.

TI  - Childhood parasomnia--a disorder of sleep maturation?

LID - 10.1016/j.ejpn.2013.05.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood parasomnias are believed to be a benign disorder due to 
      immaturity of some neural circuits, synapses and receptors. The aim of our study was 
      to explore a possible connection with other neurological developmental disorders. 
      METHODS: 72 children (mean age 9.9 ± 5.0 years, 47 boys) were clinically examined 
      and 88 nocturnal v-PSG and 22 v-EEG recordings were evaluated. The most frequent 
      diagnostic findings were: sleepwalking in 24 children, confusional arousal in 21, 
      sleep terror in 8, groaning and enuresis each in 7, non-specific arousal disorder in 
      4 patients, and REM-related parasomnia in only one child. For statistical evaluation 
      chi-square test, the two-sample t-test and Mann-Whitney rank test were used. 
      RESULTS: Perinatal risk history was found in 38% of the cohort. Developmental 
      disorders were diagnosed in 30 children (41.7%), more frequently in combinations 
      with: attention-hyperactivity disorder (30.6%), dyslexia and dysgraphia (13.9%), 
      developmental dysphasia (9.7%), mild motor and/or intellectual dysfunction (6.9%). 
      Abnormal movements in sleep, some of them also regarded as developmental, were 
      diagnosed in 37 children (51.4%). Sleep-related breathing disorders were found in 29 
      patients (40.3%) -snoring (29.2%) and/or sleep apnea (11.1%). Only 16.7% had no 
      comorbidity. Most of the children (60%) showed 2 or 3, exceptionally up to 5 
      comorbidities. Children, in whom no parasomnia was found in close relatives, had a 
      mild but non-significant earlier onset of the disease (4.4 ± 4.0 against 6.3 ± 4.3 
      years). CONCLUSION: Childhood parasomnias are frequently associated with perinatal 
      risk factors and developmental comorbidities, and can be regarded as a disorder of 
      sleep maturation.

AB  - Angelman syndrome combines severe mental retardation, epilepsy, ataxia, speech 
      impairment, and unique behavior with happy demeanor, laughing, short attention span, 
      hyperactivity, and sleep disturbance. Occurrence has been calculated at 1:20000 to 
      1:12000 constituting about 6% of all children with severe mental retardation and 
      epilepsy. The physical "prototype" includes microcephaly with flat neck, fair skin 
      and hair, wide-spaced teeth, and open mouth with tongue protrusion. Epilepsy is 
      characterized by atypical absences, erratic myoclonus, and occasional tonic-clonic 
      seizures. EEG demonstrates high-amplitude 2-3Hz delta activity with spike and 
      slow-wave discharges and sleep-activated generalized epileptiform discharges. Sodium 
      valproate, benzodiazepines, and priacetam are frequently used and effective. 
      Development is generally slow, the majority attaining independent walking in the 
      first 2.5-6 years. Vocabulary is limited to a few single words with superior speech 
      and object apprehension. The condition is due to a lack of expression of the UBE3A 
      gene on chromosome 15q. Maternal deletions of 15q11-13 produce the most pronounced 
      phenotype (65-70% of probands), uniparental disomy and imprinting center mutations 
      (10%), and UBE3A point mutations (11%) produce milder phenotypes.

AB  - Patients with liver cirrhosis may present impaired sleep-wake and circadian rhythms, 
      relative adrenal insufficiency and altered hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland 
      (HPA) axis. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Circadian rhythms are 
      modulated by corticosteroids which secretion is regulated by HPA axis. 
      Hyperammonemia alters circadian rhythms of activity and corticosterone in rats. The 
      aims were: (1) assessing whether corticosterone alterations are responsible for 
      altered circadian rhythm in hyperammonemia: (2) to shed light on the mechanism by 
      which corticosterone circadian rhythm is altered in hyperammonemia. The effects of 
      daily corticosterone injection at ZT10 on circadian rhythms of activity, plasma 
      corticosterone, adreno-corticotropic hormone (ACTH) and hypothalamic corticotropic 
      releasing hormone (CRH) were assessed in control and hyperammonemic rats. 
      ACTH-induced corticosterone release was analyzed in cultured adrenal cells. 
      Corticosterone injection restores the corticosterone peak in hyperammonemic rats and 
      their activity and circadian rhythm. Plasma ACTH and CRH in hypothalamus are 
      increased in hyperammonemic rats. Corticosterone injection normalizes ACTH. Chronic 
      hyperammonemia impairs adrenal function, reduces corticosterone content and 
      ACTH-induced corticosterone release in adrenals, leading to reduced feedback 
      modulation of HPA axis by corticosterone which contributes to impair circadian 
      rhythms of activity. Impaired circadian rhythms and motor activity may be corrected 
      in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy by corticosterone treatment.

AB  - An international workshop on juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) was conducted in 
      Avignon, France in May 2011. During that workshop, a group of 45 experts on JME, 
      together with one of the founding fathers of the syndrome of JME ("Janz syndrome"), 
      Prof. Dr. Dieter Janz from Berlin, reached a consensus on diagnostic criteria and 
      management of JME. The international experts on JME proposed two sets of criteria, 
      which will be helpful for both clinical and scientific purposes. Class I criteria 
      encompass myoclonic jerks without loss of consciousness exclusively occurring on or 
      after awakening and associated with typical generalized epileptiform EEG 
      abnormalities, with an age of onset between 10 and 25. Class II criteria allow the 
      inclusion of myoclonic jerks predominantly occurring after awakening, generalized 
      epileptiform EEG abnormalities with or without concomitant myoclonic jerks, and a 
      greater time window for age at onset (6-25years). For both sets of criteria, 
      patients should have a clear history of myoclonic jerks predominantly occurring 
      after awakening and an EEG with generalized epileptiform discharges supporting a 
      diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Patients with JME require special 
      management because their epilepsy starts in the vulnerable period of adolescence 
      and, accordingly, they have lifestyle issues that typically increase the likelihood 
      of seizures (sleep deprivation, exposure to stroboscopic flashes in discos, alcohol 
      intake, etc.) with poor adherence to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Results of an 
      inventory of the different clinical management strategies are given. This article is 
      part of a supplemental special issue entitled Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy: What is 
      it Really?

AB  - The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) consist of a group of diseases with 
      myoclonic seizures and progressive neurodegeneration, with onset in childhood and/or 
      adolescence. Lafora disease is a neuronal glycogenosis in which normal glycogen is 
      transformed into starch-like polyglucosans that accumulate in the neuronal 
      somatodendritic compartment. It is caused by defects of two genes of yet unknown 
      function, one encoding a glycogen phosphatase (laforin) and the other an ubiquitin 
      E3 ligase (malin). Early cognitive deterioration, visual seizures affecting over 
      half, and slowing down of EEG basic activity are three major diagnostic clues. 
      Unverricht-Lundborg disease is presently thought to be due to damage to neurons by 
      lysosomal cathepsins and reactive oxygen species due to absence of cystatin B, a 
      small protein that inactivates cathepsins and, by ways yet unknown, quenches 
      damaging redox compounds. Preserved cognition and background EEG activity, action 
      myoclonus early morning and vertex spikes in REM sleep are the diagnostic clues. 
      Sialidosis, with cherry-red spot, neuronopathic Gaucher disease, with paralysis of 
      verticality, and ataxia-PME, with ataxia at onset in the middle of the first decade, 
      are also lysosomal diseases. How the lysosomal defect culminates in myoclonus and 
      epilepsy in these conditions remains unknown.

AB  - Epilepsy has protean manifestations and may be diagnosed when two unprovoked 
      seizures have occurred. This determination is nearly always based on the available 
      history because most seizures have stopped long before patients arrive at medical 
      care. Great care must be taken, even by experts, to correctly interpret the history 
      and there is strong evidence that incorrect diagnoses are frequent. An abnormal EEG 
      cannot rule epilepsy in or out unless an actual seizure is recorded. When the 
      diagnosis of epilepsy is based only on two seizures, the seizures are usually 
      generalized tonic-clonic. Less "severe" seizure types usually occur multiple times 
      before prompting a medical visit. Some patients present with what seems to be a 
      first generalized tonic-clonic seizure but have a history of less severe attacks 
      that have not brought them to medical attention - epilepsy can then be diagnosed. 
      Others present with staring spells, episodes of confusion, body jerks, spasms, 
      drops, loss of speech and social interactions and/or cognitive function, paroxysmal 
      events during sleep, and febrile seizures. This chapter examines and considers the 
      differential diagnoses for each of these modes of presentation. The consequences of 
      a missed alternate diagnosis, such as cardiac arrhythmia, may be profound.

AB  - Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) cation channels are 
      encoded by HCN1-4 gene family and have four subtypes. These channels are activated 
      upon hyperpolarization of membrane potential and conduct an inward, excitatory 
      current Ih in the nervous system. Ih acts as pacemaker current to initiate rhythmic 
      firing, dampen dendritic excitability and regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter 
      release. This review summarizes recent insights into the cellular functions of Ih 
      and associated behavior such as learning and memory, sleep and arousal. HCN channels 
      are excellent targets of various cellular signals to finely regulate neuronal 
      responses to external stimuli. Numerous mechanisms, including transcriptional 
      control, trafficking, as well as channel assembly and modiﬁcation, underlie HCN 
      channel regulation. In the next section, we discuss how the intracellular signals, 
      especially recent findings concerning protein kinases and interacting proteins such 
      as cGKII, Ca(2+)/CaMKII and TRIP8b, regulate function and expression of HCN 
      channels, and subsequently provide an overview of the effects of neurotransmitters 
      on HCN channels and their corresponding intracellular mechanisms. We also discuss 
      the dysregulation of HCN channels in pathological conditions. Finally, insight into 
      future directions in this exciting area of ion channel research is provided.

AB  - In the current study the link among the γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)/pentylenetetrazole 
      (PTZ)-induced absence-like seizures and concomitant decreases in the core 
      temperature, as well as electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during rewarming from 
      deep hypothermia produced by a drug-free protocol were investigated. During the 
      rewarming period after deep cooling, most Wistar rats suffered from bilaterally 
      synchronous spike and waves with no or mild behavioral correlates. Spike and wave 
      seizures were temperature-dependent and were initially registered when body 
      temperature (Tb) reached 25-27°C, but mostly during the mild hypothermia of 
      0.3-1.3°C (Tb of 36.3-37.3°C). In chemical absence models, spike and wave discharges 
      were also closely accompanied by mild systemic hypothermia, as both PTZ- and 
      GHB-induced temperature decreases ranged from about 1-1.4°C respectively, together 
      with EEG markers of absence activity. Thus, throughout the different experimental 
      designs, the occurrence of spike and wave discharges was always related to a mild 
      (0.3-1.4°C) decrease of Tb. Benzodiazepine diazepam as the GABAA-positive allosteric 
      modulator and CGP 62349 as the selective antagonist of GABAB receptors were used to 
      determine if their well-known anticonvulsant properties also affect hypothermia 
      elicited by these drugs. Finally, during the course of spontaneous rewarming from 
      deep hypothermia, another selective GABAB-blocking agent, CGP 35348, was used to 
      elucidate if GABAB inhibitory system could be critically implicated in the 
      generation of hypothermia-dependent spike and waves. Diazepam prevented both the 
      PTZ-induced hypothermia and electrographic absence seizures, but these two 
      beneficial effects did not occur in the GHB model. Even though diazepam delayed 
      GHB-induced maximal temperature decrease, the GHB effects remained highly 
      significant. The GABAB antagonist CGP 62349 completely prevented hypothermia as well 
      as absence seizures in both chemical models. Likewise, spike and wave discharges, 
      registered during the spontaneous rewarming from deep hypothermia, were completely 
      prevented by CGP 35348. These findings show that systemic hypothermia should 
      definitely be regarded as a marker of GABAB receptor activation. Moreover, the 
      results of this study clearly show that initial mild temperature decrease should be 
      considered as strong absence-provoking factor. Hypothermia-induced nonconvulsive 
      seizures also highlight the importance of continuous EEG monitoring in children 
      undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Since every change in 
      peripheral or systemic temperature ultimately must be perceived by preoptic region 
      of the anterior hypothalamus as the primary thermoregulatory and sleep-inducing 
      center, the preoptic thermosensitive neurons in general and warm-sensitive neurons 
      in particular, simply have to be regarded as the most probable candidate for 
      connected thermoregulatory and absence generating mechanisms. Therefore, additional 
      studies are needed to confirm their potential role in the generation and propagation 
      of absence seizures.

TI  - Seizure and developmental outcomes after hemispherectomy in children and adolescents 
      with intractable epilepsy.
PG  - 475-88
LID - 10.1007/s00381-012-1949-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to describe a series of pediatric 
      hemispherectomies, reviewing pathologic substrate, epilepsy characteristics and 
      seizure outcome as well as developmental profiles, before and after surgery, in 
      different domains. METHODS: Seventeen patients with full pre-surgical work-up, 
      minimum follow-up of 12 months, and at least one post-surgical neuropsychological 
      evaluation were selected. Three had Rasmussen encephalitis (RE), five hemispheric 
      malformations of cortical development (MCD), and nine hemispheric vascular lesions. 
      RESULTS: At latest follow-up, all patients with RE and 66.7 % of those with vascular 
      lesions are in Engel's class I; in the latter group, pre-surgical independent 
      contralateral EEG discharges statistically correlated with a worse seizure outcome. 
      Patients with MCD showed the worst seizure outcome. Pre-surgical language transfer 
      to the right hemisphere was confirmed in a boy with left RE, operated on at 6 years 
      of age. Patients with MCD and vascular lesions already showed severe global 
      developmental delay before surgery, which persists afterwards. A linear correlation 
      was found between earlier age at surgery and better outcome in personal-social, 
      gross motor, and adaptive domains, in the vascular lesions group. The case with 
      highest cognitive improvement had continuous spike and wave during sleep on 
      pre-surgical EEG. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic substrate was the main factor related with 
      seizure outcome. In children with MCD and vascular lesions, although developmental 
      progression is apparent, significant post-surgical improvements are restricted by 
      the severity of pre-surgical neuropsychological disturbances and a slow maturation. 
      Early surgery assessment is recommended to enhance the possibilities for a better 
      quality of life in terms of seizure control, as well as better autonomy and 
      socialization.

AB  - Increasing numbers of patients survive traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 
      cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation and are admitted to the ICU in coma. Some 
      of these patients become brain dead; others regain consciousness. Still others 
      become vegetative or minimally conscious, conditions called chronic disorders of 
      consciousness and ultimately are cared for outside the ICU. Comatose patients lack 
      the wakefulness and awareness that distinguish consciousness from unconsciousness. 
      Vegetative patients are awake in that they manifest sleep-wake cycles, but they are 
      unaware of their environment and cannot respond to stimuli. Minimally conscious 
      patients are awake, aware to a limited extent, and somewhat responsive. The 
      diagnosis of the vegetative and minimally conscious states has been based largely on 
      their behavioral and pathologic features, and it has been believed that vegetative 
      patients remain in that condition permanently. Nevertheless, EEG and neuroimaging 
      studies suggest that the traditional diagnostic approach is imprecise. Moreover, 
      clinical investigations have revealed that some vegetative patients can become 
      minimally conscious and that some minimally conscious patients can gain increased 
      awareness. Few therapies for patients with chronic disorders of consciousness have 
      been subjected to randomized trials. Furthermore, although a small number of 
      patients have improved neurologically with or without treatment, their overall 
      prognosis for neurologic recovery remains poor.

AB  - Serotonergic neurotoxicity following MDMA is well-established in laboratory animals, 
      and neuroimaging studies have found lower serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in 
      abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users. Serotonin is a modulator for many different 
      psychobiological functions, and this review will summarize the evidence for 
      equivalent functional deficits in recreational users. Declarative memory, 
      prospective memory, and higher cognitive skills are often impaired. Neurocognitive 
      deficits are associated with reduced SERT in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and 
      prefrontal cortex. EEG and ERP studies have shown localised reductions in brain 
      activity during neurocognitive performance. Deficits in sleep, mood, vision, pain, 
      psychomotor skill, tremor, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status, have also 
      been demonstrated. The children of mothers who take Ecstasy/MDMA during pregnancy 
      have developmental problems. These psychobiological deficits are wide-ranging, and 
      occur in functions known to be modulated by serotonin. They are often related to 
      lifetime dosage, with light users showing slight changes, and heavy users displaying 
      more pronounced problems. In summary, abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users can show deficits 
      in a wide range of biobehavioral functions with a serotonergic component.

AB  - Melanopsin (OPN4) is a photosensitive G-protein-coupled photopigment and its ectopic 
      expression enables control of neural activity induced by blue light. Here we report 
      that we successfully expressed OPN4 in hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neurons of 
      double-transgenic mice (orexin-tTA; Bitet-O human OPN4 [hOPN4]/mCherry mice). In the 
      double-transgenic mice, hypothalamic orexin neurons selectively expressed hOPN4 as 
      well as mCherry as a reporter. We conducted slice patch-clamp recordings on 
      hOPN4/mCherry-expressing orexin neurons, which showed long-lasting activation 
      initiated by blue light even after the light was switched off. Optical fiber-guided 
      blue light stimulation in the hypothalamus successfully initiated the 
      electroencephalography pattern that reflects long-lasting wakefulness in the mice in 
      vivo. Taken together, the results indicate that ectopic expression of hOPN4 in 
      orexin neurons enables long-lasting activation of orexin neurons by blue light to 
      control sleep/wakefulness of the mice.

AB  - Neurofeedback may be useful for improving sports performance but few studies have 
      examined this potential. Here we present data of five development players from a 
      major league baseball team. The aims were to evaluate the feasibility of conducting 
      sessions within a professional organization, assess changes in quantitative 
      electroencephalograph (QEEG), NeuroPerformance Profile™, and report qualitative 
      self-report data before and after brain training. The EEG was recorded with 19 
      electrodes for 20 min of baseline conditions and approximately 21 min of a 
      continuous performance test. The fast Fourier transform analysis provided average 
      cross-spectral matrices for bands delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-12 
      Hz), low beta (13-16 Hz), beta 1 (13-21 Hz), beta 2 (22-32 Hz), and gamma (32-45 Hz) 
      from the pre and post intervention evaluations in the baseline condition of eyes 
      open. The continuous performance test metrics included the errors of omission, 
      errors of commission, response time and response time variability. The 9 scales of 
      the NeuroPerformance Profile™ were examined. The QEEG data, CPT data and 
      NeuroPerformance Profile™ data were all compared between the pre and post 15 
      sessions of brain training using a within subject paired t test design corrected for 
      multiple comparisons using false discovery rate method. Following brain training, 
      comparative QEEG, CPT and NeuroPerformance Profile™ analyses illustrated significant 
      differences. The QEEG findings of all participants illustrated significant changes 
      within the training parameters but also across other frequency bands and electrode 
      sites. Overall, the positive findings in both objective and subjective measures 
      suggest further inquiry into the utility of brain training for performance 
      enhancement with the specific application of sport is warranted. Particularly QEEG 
      and CPT gains were noted in the areas that correspond to client self-report data 
      demonstrating improvement in attention, decreased intrusive thought patterns and 
      improvements in sleep patterns.

TI  - A longitudinal study of delirium phenomenology indicates widespread neural 
      dysfunction.
PG  - 187-96
LID - 10.1017/S147895151300093X [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Delirium affects all higher cortical functions supporting complex 
      information processing consistent with widespread neural network impairment. We 
      evaluated the relative prominence of delirium symptoms throughout episodes to assess 
      whether impaired consciousness is selectively affecting certain brain functions at 
      different timepoints. METHODS: Twice-weekly assessments of 100 consecutive patients 
      with DSM-IV delirium in a palliative care unit used the Delirium Rating Scale 
      Revised-98 (DRS-R98) and Cognitive Test for Delirium (CTD). A mixed-effects model 
      was employed to estimate changes in severity of individual symptoms over time. 
      RESULTS: Mean age = 7 0.2 ± 10.5 years, 51% were male, and 27 had a comorbid 
      dementia. A total of 323 assessments (range 2-9 per case) were conducted, but up to 
      6 are reported herein. Frequency and severity of individual DRS-R98 symptoms was 
      very consistent over time even though the majority of patients (80%) experienced 
      fluctuation in symptom severity over the course of hours or minutes. Over time, 
      DRS-R98 items for attention (88-100%), sleep-wake cycle disturbance (90-100%), and 
      any motor disturbance (87-100%), and CTD attention and vigilance were most 
      frequently and consistently impaired. Mixed-effects regression modeling identified 
      only very small magnitudes of change in individual symptoms over time, including the 
      three core domains. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Attention is disproportionately 
      impaired during the entire episode of delirium, consistent with thalamic dysfunction 
      underlying both an impaired state of consciousness and well-known EEG slowing. All 
      individual symptoms and three core domains remain relatively stable despite small 
      fluctuations in symptom severity for a given day, which supports a consistent state 
      of impaired higher cortical functions throughout an episode of delirium.

LID - e62430
AB  - Multiplicity of oscillatory phenomena in a range of infra-slow frequencies (<0.01 
      Hz) has been described in mammalian brains at different levels of organisation. The 
      significance and manifestation in physiology and/or behaviour of many brain 
      infra-slow oscillations (ISO) remain unknown. Examples of this phenomenon are two 
      types of ISO observed in the brains of urethane-anaesthetised rats: infra-slow, 
      rhythmic changes in the rate of action potential firing in a few nuclei of the 
      subcortical visual system and a sleep-like cycle of activation/deactivation visible 
      in the EEG signal. Because both of these rhythmic phenomena involve brain networks 
      that can influence autonomic nervous system activity, we hypothesised that these two 
      brain ISOs can be reflected by rhythmic changes of pupil size. Thus, in the present 
      study, we used simultaneous pupillography and ECoG recording to verify the 
      hypothesised existence of infra-slow oscillations in the pupil size of 
      urethane-anaesthetised rats. The obtained results showed rhythmic changes in the 
      size of the pupils and rhythmic eyeball movements in urethane-anaesthetised rats. 
      The observed rhythms were characterised by two different dominant components in a 
      range of infra-slow frequencies. First, the long component had a period of ≈ 29 
      minutes and was present in both the irises and the eyeball movements. Second, the 
      short component had a period of ≈ 2 minutes and was observed only in the rhythmic 
      constrictions and dilations of the pupils. Both ISOs were simultaneously present in 
      both eyes, and they were synchronised between the left and right eye. The long ISO 
      component was synchronised with the cyclic alternations of the brain state, as 
      revealed by rhythmic changes in the pattern of the ECoG signal. Based on the 
      obtained results, we propose a model of interference of ISO present in different 
      brain systems involved in the control of pupil size.

TI  - Mice expressing the ADNFLE valine 287 leucine mutation of the Β2 nicotinic

      administration and altered presynaptic nicotinic receptor function.

AB  - Several mutations in α4 or β2 nicotinic receptor subunits are linked to autosomal 
      dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). One such missense mutation in the 
      gene encoding the β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit 
      (CHRNB2) is a valine-to-leucine substitution in the second transmembrane domain at 
      position 287 (β2VL). Previous studies indicated that the β2VL mutation in mice 
      alters circadian rhythm consistent with sleep alterations observed in ADNFLE 
      patients (Xu et al., 2011). The current study investigates changes in nicotinic 
      receptor function and expression that may explain the behavioral phenotype of β2VL 
      mice. No differences in β2 mRNA expression were found between wild-type (WT) and 
      heterozygous (HT) or homozygous mutant (MT) mice. However, antibody and ligand 
      binding indicated that the mutation resulted in a reduction in receptor protein. 
      Functional consequences of the β2VL mutation were assessed biochemically using crude 
      synaptosomes. A gene-dose dependent increase in sensitivity to activation by 
      acetylcholine and decrease in maximal nAChR-mediated [(3)H]-dopamine release and 
      (86)Rb efflux were observed. Maximal nAChR-mediated [(3)H]-GABA release in the 
      cortex was also decreased in the MT, but maximal [(3)H]-GABA release was retained in 
      the hippocampus. Behaviorally both HT and MT mice demonstrated increased sensitivity 
      to nicotine-induced hypolocomotion and hypothermia. Furthermore, WT mice display 
      only a tonic-clonic seizure (EEG recordable) 3 min after injection of a high dose of 
      nicotine, while MT mice also display a dystonic arousal complex (non-EEG recordable) 
      event 30s after nicotine injection. Data indicate decreases in maximal response for 
      certain measures are larger than expected given the decrease in receptor expression.

AB  - Recent advances have been made in the network mechanisms underlying impairment of 
      consciousness during seizures. However, less is known about patient awareness of 
      their own seizures. Studying patient reports or documentation of their seizures is 
      currently the most commonly utilized mechanism to scientifically measure patient 
      awareness of seizures. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available 
      evidence regarding the accuracy of patient seizure counts and identify the variables 
      that may influence unreliable seizure reporting. Several groups looking at patient 
      documentation of seizures during continuous EEG monitoring show that patients do not 
      report as many as 50% of their seizures. These studies also suggest that seizures 
      accompanied by loss of consciousness, arising from the left hemisphere or the 
      temporal lobe, or occurring during sleep are associated with significantly reduced 
      reporting. Baseline memory performance does not appear to have a major influence on 
      the accuracy of seizure report. Further prospective studies using validated ictal 
      behavioral testing as well as using correlation with newer electrophysiological and 
      neuroimaging techniques for seizure localization are needed to more fully understand 
      the mechanisms of underreporting of seizures. Better methods to alert caregivers 
      about unrecognized seizures and to improve seizure documentation are under 
      investigation.

TI  - Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Potential role of antiepileptic drugs.
PG  - 113-9
LID - 10.1007/s40263-012-0006-1 [doi]
AB  - Among people with epilepsy, there is a 20-fold higher risk of dying suddenly and 
      unexpectedly compared with the general population. This phenomenon is called sudden 
      unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and the term is used when sudden death occurs 
      in an otherwise reasonably healthy person with epilepsy and the autopsy is 
      unrevealing. In most cases, SUDEP occurs during sleep and is unwitnessed. Risk 
      factors for SUDEP include the presence or number of generalized tonic-clonic 
      seizures (GTCS), nocturnal seizures, young age at epilepsy onset, longer duration of 
      epilepsy, dementia, absence of cerebrovascular disease, asthma, male gender, 
      symptomatic aetiology of epilepsy and alcohol abuse. Suggested factors predisposing 
      to SUDEP have included long-QT-related mutations, impaired serotonergic brain stem 
      control of respiration, altered autonomic control and seizures with a pronounced 
      postictal suppression and respiratory compromise. Final events that may lead up to 
      SUDEP are a postictal CNS shutdown with pronounced EEG suppression, ictal or 
      postictal apnoea, and ictal cardiac arrhythmia. It is unknown whether antiepileptic 
      drugs (AEDs) modify the risk for SUDEP. Studies have consistently found that the 
      presence or number of GTCS is associated with an increased risk for SUDEP. Since 
      continued presence of GTCS clearly necessitates the use of AEDs, both factors must 
      be taken into account to determine whether one or both increases the risk for SUDEP. 
      Some studies suggest that AEDs, such as lamotrigine and carbamazepine, may increase 
      the risk of SUDEP, but rarely adjust for GTCS. Other studies, which have found that 
      AEDs are associated with a decreased SUDEP risk, either adjust for the number of 
      GTCS or are meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials. Studies assessing the 
      impact of AEDs on the risk for SUDEP are limited because SUDEP is a rare event, 
      making randomized clinical trials impossible to conduct. Observational studies focus 
      on whether or not an AED was prescribed. When postmortem AED concentrations are 
      assessed they are usually low or absent, perhaps due to sampling in deceased 
      individuals, making it difficult to fully resolve whether AEDs increase or decrease 
      SUDEP risk. Despite these caveats, the evidence suggests that AEDs are not 
      associated with an increased risk for SUDEP on a population level, although some 
      individuals may be susceptible to effects of AEDs. Recent evidence from a 
      meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of adjunctive AEDs at efficacious doses 
      provides strong support for AED treatment as mono- or polytherapy to increase 
      seizure control and protect against SUDEP in patients with refractory epilepsy. For 
      patients for whom seizure control is unattainable, supervision or monitoring may 
      prevent SUDEP, though this has never been formally tested.

TI  - Atypical parkinsonism due to a D202N Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker prion protein 
      mutation: first in vivo diagnosed case.
PG  - 241-4
LID - 10.1002/mds.25188 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinsonism with dopa-sensitivity and a correlating DaTSCAN turned out 
      to be due to a D202N mutation which is associated with the 
      Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease. METHODS/RESULTS: We report a 51-year 
      old female who presented with left-dominant parkinsonism and a positive DaTSCAN. She 
      was diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's syndrome. Dopaminergic medication reduced 
      her symptoms. In addition, punding-like behavior, deficits in organizing daily life 
      and abnormal sleep behavior were reported. Neuropsychological testing, EEG, 
      polysomnography as well as PET imaging with fluorodexyglucose (FDG), 
      [F-18]-desmethoxyfallypride (DMFP), and [C-11]-6-OH-BTA-1 (PIB) were not diagnostic. 
      Cerebral spinal fluid analysis revealed no 14-3-3 protein, but elevated 
      neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100-beta and a very low phospho-tau/total-tau 
      ratio. Analysis of the prion gene disclosed the rare D202N mutation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The D202N prion mutation has been associated with GSS pathology and up to now was 
      only reported post mortem. Our patient is the very first case diagnosed in vivo.

TI  - Prospective investigation of autism and genotype-phenotype correlations in 22q13 
      deletion syndrome and SHANK3 deficiency.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/2040-2392-4-18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 22q13 deletion syndrome, also known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, is a 
      neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, 
      delayed or absent speech, and autistic features. SHANK3 has been identified as the 
      critical gene in the neurological and behavioral aspects of this syndrome. The 
      phenotype of SHANK3 deficiency has been described primarily from case studies, with 
      limited evaluation of behavioral and cognitive deficits. The present study used a 
      prospective design and inter-disciplinary clinical evaluations to assess patients 
      with SHANK3 deficiency, with the goal of providing a comprehensive picture of the 
      medical and behavioral profile of the syndrome. METHODS: A serially ascertained 
      sample of patients with SHANK3 deficiency (n = 32) was evaluated by a team of child 
      psychiatrists, neurologists, clinical geneticists, molecular geneticists and 
      psychologists. Patients were evaluated for autism spectrum disorder using the Autism 
      Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-G. 
      RESULTS: Thirty participants with 22q13.3 deletions ranging in size from 101 kb to 
      8.45 Mb and two participants with de novo SHANK3 mutations were included. The sample 
      was characterized by high rates of autism spectrum disorder: 27 (84%) met criteria 
      for autism spectrum disorder and 24 (75%) for autistic disorder. Most patients (77%) 
      exhibited severe to profound intellectual disability and only five (19%) used some 
      words spontaneously to communicate. Dysmorphic features, hypotonia, gait 
      disturbance, recurring upper respiratory tract infections, gastroesophageal reflux 
      and seizures were also common. Analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations indicated 
      that larger deletions were associated with increased levels of dysmorphic features, 
      medical comorbidities and social communication impairments related to autism. 
      Analyses of individuals with small deletions or point mutations identified features 
      related to SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, including ASD, seizures and abnormal EEG, 
      hypotonia, sleep disturbances, abnormal brain MRI, gastroesophageal reflux, and 
      certain dysmorphic features. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports findings from previous 
      research on the severity of intellectual, motor, and speech impairments seen in 
      SHANK3 deficiency, and highlights the prominence of autism spectrum disorder in the 
      syndrome. Limitations of existing evaluation tools are discussed, along with the 
      need for natural history studies to inform clinical monitoring and treatment 
      development in SHANK3 deficiency.

TI  - Fluctuations in cognition and alertness vary independently in dementia with Lewy 
      bodies.
PG  - 83-9
LID - 10.1002/mds.25707 [doi]
AB  - Fluctuations in mental status are 1 of the core diagnostic criteria for dementia 
      with Lewy bodies (DLB) and are thought to reflect variability in daytime alertness. 
      Previous attempts to study fluctuations have been limited to caregiver reports, 
      observer rating scales, short segments of electroencephalography, or 
      motor-dependent, reaction time tests. Concordance among such measures is often poor, 
      and fluctuations remain difficult to quantify. We compared fluctuations in cognition 
      and alertness in patients with DLB (n = 13) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      (n = 64), a condition associated with deficits in daytime alertness. We 
      systematically and repeatedly collected cognitive and physiologic measures during a 
      48-hour inpatient protocol in a sound-attenuated sleep laboratory in a geriatric 
      hospital. Cognitive fluctuations were analyzed using coefficients of variation 
      (COVs) derived from performance on a bedside examination familiar to clinicians 
      (digit span). Alertness fluctuations were assessed objectively using COVs from the 
      polysomnographically-based Maintenance of Wakefulness Test. Despite predictably 
      lower mean digit span performances, DLB patients demonstrated significantly greater 
      cognitive fluctuations than PD patients (P < 0.001), even when groups were matched 
      on general cognitive impairment. There were no group differences in alertness 
      fluctuations, although DLB patients were less alert than PD patients not receiving 
      dopaminergics. The prevailing assumption that fluctuations in cognition in DLB are 
      reflected in fluctuations in daytime alertness was not supported by objective, 
      physiological measurements. Fluctuating mental status in DLB patients can be 
      detected with repeated administration of a simple bedside exam that can be adapted 
      to a clinic setting.

TI  - Racial and ethnic differences in subspecialty service use by children with autism.
PG  - 94-100
LID - 10.1542/peds.2012-3886 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe racial differences in use of specialty care among children 
      with autism spectrum disorder. METHODS: We identified patients ages 2 to 21 years 
      with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code of autism 
      (299.0) seen from 2000 to 2011 at a major academic health center by using a research 
      patient data repository and determined rates of specialty provider visits and 
      procedures by race. We then used logistic regression to determine the associations 
      of rates of subspecialty visits and procedures with race and ethnicity, controlling 
      for gender, age, and payer type. RESULTS: We identified 3615 patients (2935 white, 
      243 Hispanic, 188 African American, and 249 other). The most striking differences 
      were in use of gastroenterology (GI)/nutrition services. Nonwhite children were less 
      likely to use GI/nutrition specialty providers (African American, odds ratio = 0.32 
      [95th percentile confidence interval: 0.18-0.55]; Hispanic, 0.32 [0.20-0.51]; other, 
      0.56 [0.34-0.92]) as well as neurology (African American, 0.52 [0.33-0.83]; 
      Hispanic, 0.40 [0.27-0.59]) and psychiatry/psychology (African American, 0.44 
      [0.27-0.72]; Hispanic, 0.60 [0.41-0.88]; other, 0.62 [0.38-0.99]). Nonwhite children 
      were less likely to have had GI studies: colonoscopy (African American, 0.23 
      [0.10-0.53]; Hispanic, 0.26 [0.14-0.50]), endoscopy (African American, 0.31 
      [0.16-0.58]; Hispanic, 0.27 [0.16-0.46]; other, 0.53 [0.31-0.90]), and stool studies 
      (African American, 0.49 [0.30-0.91]). Hispanic children had lower rates of 
      neurologic and other testing: EEG (Hispanic, 0.53 [0.35-0.78]), brain MRI (African 
      American, 0.37 [0.22-0.63]; Hispanic, 0.62 [0.42-0.90]), sleep study (Hispanic, 0.18 
      [0.04-0.76]), and neuropsychiatric testing (Hispanic, 0.55 [0.32-0.96]). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We found racial and ethnic differences among children diagnosed with 
      autism in use of care and procedures. Possible explanations for these findings 
      include differences in presentation, referral rates, or referral follow through.

TI  - Otoneurologic findings in a fishermen population of the state of santa catarina: 
      preliminary study.
PG  - 6-10
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1358584 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Fishing, one of the oldest productive activities, is an important 
      sector of the national and world economy. Aim To evaluate the vestibular behavior in 
      a population of fishermen. Methods In a retrospective and cross-sectional study, 13 
      fishermen (mean 45.0), between 33 and 62 years of age, were submitted to anamnesis, 
      otorhinolaryngological evaluation, and vestibular exam through the vector 
      electronystagmography. Results The most evident otoneurologic symptoms were hearing 
      loss (76.9%), tinnitus (61.7%), dizziness (46.1%), and headache (46.1%). The most 
      evident clinical symptoms were fatigue (46.1%), depression (23.0%), anxiety (15.3%), 
      insomnia (7.7%), and agitation during sleep (7.7%). There were alterations in the 
      vestibular exam in 5 fishermen (38.5%) discovered in the caloric test. There was a 
      prevalence of alteration in the peripheral vestibular system. There was a major 
      frequency of the peripheral vestibular irritative syndrome. Conclusion The 
      otoneurologic complaints were frequent in the population studied to verify the 
      importance of allowing labyrinth exams and the need for adopting preventive measures 
      relating to noise exposure as well as carbon monoxide exposure, because they can 
      cause and/or enhance various manifestations of labyrinthine vestibular impairment 
      that can affect the quality of life of these workers.
